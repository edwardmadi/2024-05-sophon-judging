# Lack of event emission for critical state changes leads to  reduced transparency and auditing challenges

## Summary
In the **`SophonFarming`** contract, several functions that perform critical state changes do not emit events. Specifically, functions like **`setBridge`**, **`setL2FarmForPool`**, **`setStartBlock`**, and **`setEndBlock`** update important parameters without logging these changes to the blockchain. The absence of event emissions for these significant updates reduces the transparency of the contract's operations and makes it difficult for users and auditors to track changes and detect potential malicious activities.
## Vulnerability Detail
The root cause of this vulnerability is the absence of event emissions in critical state-changing functions. Event emissions are essential in smart contracts as they log important changes and actions to the blockchain, making them visible to users and external monitoring tools. Without these events, critical updates to the contract's state occur silently, with no way for external observers to be notified.

- **Hidden Malicious Activities**: If an attacker gains control of the contract and changes critical parameters, these changes could go unnoticed due to the lack of event emissions.
- **Unintentional Misconfigurations**: Legitimate changes by the contract owner may also go unnoticed, making it harder to verify the correctness of these changes.
- **Audit Challenges**: Auditors rely on events to understand the contract's behavior over time. Without events, they may miss important context and fail to detect security issues.
## Impact
The lack of event emission for critical state changes can lead to reduced transparency and make it challenging to audit the contract's behavior effectively. This could hide malicious activities or unintentional misconfigurations, potentially leading to the manipulation of the protocol without detection. Users and auditors rely on events to track changes in the contract's state, and without these events, it becomes much harder to ensure the integrity and security of the protocol.
## Code Snippet
Below is a code snippet showing functions that perform critical state changes without emitting events:

```solidity
function setBridge(BridgeLike _bridge) public onlyOwner {
    bridge = _bridge;
    // Missing event emission
}

function setL2FarmForPool(uint256 _pid, address _l2Farm) public onlyOwner {
    poolInfo[_pid].l2Farm = _l2Farm;
    // Missing event emission
}

function setStartBlock(uint256 _startBlock) public onlyOwner {
    if (_startBlock == 0 || (endBlock != 0 && _startBlock >= endBlock)) {
        revert InvalidStartBlock();
    }
    if (getBlockNumber() > startBlock) {
        revert FarmingIsStarted();
    }
    startBlock = _startBlock;
    // Missing event emission
}

function setEndBlock(uint256 _endBlock, uint256 _withdrawalBlocks) public onlyOwner {
    uint256 _endBlockForWithdrawals;
    if (_endBlock != 0) {
        if (_endBlock <= startBlock || getBlockNumber() > _endBlock) {
            revert InvalidEndBlock();
        }
        if (isFarmingEnded()) {
            revert FarmingIsEnded();
        }
        _endBlockForWithdrawals = _endBlock + _withdrawalBlocks;
    } else {
        _endBlockForWithdrawals = 0;
    }
    massUpdatePools();
    endBlock = _endBlock;
    endBlockForWithdrawals = _endBlockForWithdrawals;
    // Missing event emission
}

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Emit events for all critical state changes to enhance transparency and facilitate auditing. Ensure that each function that performs significant updates logs these changes with relevant event data. This will allow users and auditors to monitor the contract's operations more effectively and detect any anomalies promptly.

```diff
+ event BridgeUpdated(address newBridge);
+ event L2FarmForPoolUpdated(uint256 pid, address newL2Farm);
+ event StartBlockUpdated(uint256 newStartBlock);
+ event EndBlockUpdated(uint256 newEndBlock, uint256 newEndBlockForWithdrawals);

function setBridge(BridgeLike _bridge) public onlyOwner {
    bridge = _bridge;
+   emit BridgeUpdated(_bridge);
}

function setL2FarmForPool(uint256 _pid, address _l2Farm) public onlyOwner {
    poolInfo[_pid].l2Farm = _l2Farm;
+   emit L2FarmForPoolUpdated(_pid, _l2Farm);
}

function setStartBlock(uint256 _startBlock) public onlyOwner {
    if (_startBlock == 0 || (endBlock != 0 && _startBlock >= endBlock)) {
        revert InvalidStartBlock();
    }
    if (getBlockNumber() > startBlock) {
        revert FarmingIsStarted();
    }
    startBlock = _startBlock;

}

function setEndBlock(uint256 _endBlock, uint256 _withdrawalBlocks) public onlyOwner {
    uint256 _endBlockForWithdrawals;
    if (_endBlock != 0) {
        if (_endBlock <= startBlock || getBlockNumber() > _endBlock) {
            revert InvalidEndBlock();
        }
        if (isFarmingEnded()) {
            revert FarmingIsEnded();
        }
        _endBlockForWithdrawals = _endBlock + _withdrawalBlocks;
    } else {
        _endBlockForWithdrawals = 0;
    }
    massUpdatePools();
    endBlock = _endBlock;
    endBlockForWithdrawals = _endBlockForWithdrawals;
