# Controlled Delegatecall

## Summary
There is a controlled delegatecall in`SophonFarmingProxy::receive` which is marked as payable but no proper safeguards have been used.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside `SophonFarmingProxy::receive` the `delegatecall` is used to forward the received Ether to the `implementation` contract but but lacks a data argument. This setup is inherently risky because it can lead to a potential reentrancy vulnerability since the `delegatecall` relies entirely on the `implementation` contract to decide what action to take.

## Impact
If the `implementation` contract is malicious or compromised, it could potentially call back into the `SophonFarmingProxy` after receiving Ether, exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability. This could allow the attacker to drain funds from the proxy contract or manipulate its state in unintended ways.

## Tool used
Manual Review + Slither

## Recommendation
Despite of the controlled nature of the upgrade mechanism in `Upgradeable2Step`, mitigating the reentrancy vulnerability in the `receive` function requires careful consideration. One approach is to implement Reentrancy Guard from Openzeppelin in the `SophonFarmingProxy` contract to prevent recursive calls. This can be done by adding a modifier that checks if the contract is currently being called recursively:

```javascript
import {ReentrancyGuard} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol"

contract SophonFarmingProxy is Proxy2Step, ReentrancyGuard {
    constructor(address impl_) Proxy2Step(impl_) {}

    receive() external override payable nonReentrant {
        (bool success,) = implementation.delegatecall("");
        require(success, "subcall failed");
    }
   ```
  This will inherit ReentrancyGuard in the contract and
