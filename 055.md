# Insufficient Validation in setBridge() Function of SophonFarming Contract

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L255


The setBridge() function in the SophonFarming contract lacks essential validations, including ensuring the provided address is not address(0), is a contract, and optionally, is owned by a trusted entity. These omissions can lead to misconfigurations and potential vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function does not validate that the _bridge address is not address(0), does not ensure the address is a contract, and does not check if the contract implements the expected interface. 

## Impact

This can lead to setting an invalid or malicious bridge address, resulting in potential misconfigurations and security risks.

Setting the bridge to a non-contract address can cause the contract to fail when interacting with the bridge.


## Code Snippet
```sol
  function setBridge(BridgeLike _bridge) public onlyOwner {
        bridge = _bridge;
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure the _bridge address is not address(0). Check that the _bridge address is a contract. Ensure the _bridge address implements the expected interface.
