# Non-boosting deposits that were not withdrawn before `endBlockForWithdrawals` are stuck in `SophonFarming` proxy

## Summary


## Vulnerability Detail

`SophonFarming` allows users to deposit an arbitrary amount of whitelisted tokens and choose how much they want to use for boosting. All deposits that were not used for boosting can be `withdrawn` by the staker. Function `withdraw` has `isWithdrawPeriodEnded` check, that does not allow withdrawals after `endBlockForWithdrawals`. The problem is that the owner can never withdraw non-boosting deposits, and stakers can do so only before `endBlockForWithdrawals`. So once withdraw period is over, nobody can withdraw non-boosting deposits from the contract.

## Impact

Stuck deposits in the contract, which can be retrieved only by upgrading the proxy.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a privileged function to rescue all tokens held by the contract after `endBlockForWithdrawals`, or allow stakers to withdraw their deposit at any time.
