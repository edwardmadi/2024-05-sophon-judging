# Able to update new startBlock greater then old startBlock

## Summary
Not checking whether the new startBlock is greater than old startBLock while updating startBlock.Hence the wrong rewards are calculated when the old start Block > current block number
## Vulnerability Detail
In the function

```solidity
function setStartBlock(uint256 _startBlock) public onlyOwner {
        if (_startBlock == 0 || (endBlock != 0 && _startBlock >= endBlock)) {
            revert InvalidStartBlock();
        }
        if (getBlockNumber() > startBlock) {
            revert FarmingIsStarted();
        }
        startBlock = _startBlock;
    }
```    

we dont have the condition to check whether the _startBlock > startBlock.
pool.lastRewardBlock still has the old value of startBLock.

## Impact
pool.lastRewardBlock will store the incorrect value of old startBlock even though new startBlock has been initialised by owner.
As a result wrong rewards will get calculated.
