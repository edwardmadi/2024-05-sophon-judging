# lastRewardBlock Of Each Pool Should Be Updated With startBlock Is Updated

## Summary

It is possible that the startblock has been assigned to a future block in the initialize function. Also , lastRewardBlock is assigned to this start block in the `add` function (called through initialize) .  When the `startBlock` is updated (let's say it is assigned to 10 blocks earlier now) via the `setStartBlock` function , we can see that `lastrRewardBlock` for each pool would point to the older startBlock and is not updated to the new startBlock . Therefore in this case the pool would start accruing rewards 10 blocks later.
PoC attached


## Vulnerability Detail

It would be best understood with a PoC , In the PoC -> 

1.) Paste the PoC in the SophonFarming.t.sol , and edit the line L125 to `startBlock = block.number + 30;`

2.) We first assign startBlock to 30 block in the future , therefore lastRewardBlock can be seen as 31

3.) In the PoC , we update the startBlock to 25 blocks in the future , therefore for each pool the lastRewardBlock should be now 26
, But it is 31 since it was not updated.


```solidity

function test_PoC() public {

       

        uint256 amountToDeposit1 = 100e18;
        uint256 poolId1 = sophonFarming.typeToId(SophonFarmingState.PredefinedPool.wstETH);

        vm.startPrank(account1);
        deal(address(wstETH), account1, amountToDeposit1);

        wstETH.approve(address(sophonFarming), amountToDeposit1);

        

        
        vm.stopPrank();

        

        vm.prank(deployer);
        sophonFarming.setStartBlock(block.number + 25);

        

        sophonFarming.getPoolInfo();
       

    }
```

Run the test with `-vvvvv` and you'll see the lastRewardBlock is still 31 , 
This means the pools would still accrue rewards from block 31 rather than 26 which is loss of points/rewards.

## Impact

Incorrect lastRewardBlock for pools would lead to incorrect rewards accrual.

## Tool used

Foundry , Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the lastRewardBlock for each pool in the `setStartBlock` function
