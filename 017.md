# Protocol might not accrue points per block and lead to non accrual of pool's `accPointsPerShare` and leading to less or zero points/rewards for  user -

## Summary
Lack of regular pool accounting updates can lead to zero or far less points to depositors who has staked for entire length of farming duration.

The protocol has not said about anything related to keeper roles and about these updates being done timely which leads to 

more likeliness of this issue.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol's farming contracts are designed for airdrop of the SOPH tokens.

The owner sets different prams like start and end block of the farming process , block multiplier and points per block 

to accrue in rewards for users who deposits in different pools .

However , the pools need to be updated regularly after some blocks so that pool's `accPointsPerShare` parameter that determines

the amount of reward a user will get is updated. This update is done by `updatePool` method which called collectively 

inside `massUpdatePools` that iterates over all the pools and updates them individually .

The `massUpdatePools` is permissionless hence can be called by anyone and is mainly the job of some `Keeper-like-role`

to update pools through this function or targetting specific pools by `updatePool` . However , `Protocol does not propose any keeper role to ensure these functions are getting called timely`.

One workaround the protocol did was to call `massUpdatePools` methods inside the `setters` of critical params 
like `setStartBlock` , `setEndBlock` `deposit` and `withdraw ` method and other param setter functions.


However these methods are not called with regular intervals `like after every 2 blocks` the deployer would not want to 

change the start and endblock , massive deposits and withdrawals etc in every other block.

So these methods will be called occasionally and more practically just in the first 10 20 blocks when protocol decides about

these params and let it running and `withdraw` method will be called after endBlock when withdraw period begins.

The protocol might assume that anyone would call updatePool method out of the good will but 

not everyone is so kind to waste their gas to run zero ROI transactions.

In the event when no `keeper-like` people call `updatePool` or `massUpdatePools` the protocol

might run into the issue of pool's `accPointsPerShare` being zero for almost all major pools 

and when this variable is used for calculating the amount of pending points ( which according to sponsors will determine actually

how many tokens the contract will give to users ) , leading to points/rewards calculated as zero or far less

than what they actually should  get) -> potential loss of airdrop of rewards even though 

people have staked from start block to end block.


The `massUpdatePools` along with underlying `updatePool` method is as follows 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L399-L435

```solidity
    function massUpdatePools() public {
        uint256 length = poolInfo.length;
        for(uint256 pid = 0; pid < length;) {
            updatePool(pid);
            unchecked { ++pid; }
        }
    }


    /**
     * @notice Updating accounting of a single pool
     * @param _pid pid to update
     */
    function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        if (getBlockNumber() <= pool.lastRewardBlock) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        uint256 _pointsPerBlock = pointsPerBlock;
        uint256 _allocPoint = pool.allocPoint;
        if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
            pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
            return;
        }
        uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());
        uint256 pointReward =
            blockMultiplier *
            _pointsPerBlock *
            _allocPoint /
            totalAllocPoint;


        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward /
            lpSupply +
            pool.accPointsPerShare;


        pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
    }
```
The core of this pool update is as follows

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L430-L432


```solidity
        uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());
        uint256 pointReward =
            blockMultiplier *
            _pointsPerBlock *
            _allocPoint /
            totalAllocPoint;

        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward /
            lpSupply +
            pool.accPointsPerShare;

```
The updatePool method essentially updates the `Price per share` accounting of the pool .

which needs to calculated after regular block intervals

because `pool.accPointsPerShare` is used in calculating the amount of pending points are the for user to use.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L357-L384

```solidity
     function _pendingPoints(uint256 _pid, address _user) internal view returns (uint256) {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user];


        uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;


        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        if (getBlockNumber() > pool.lastRewardBlock && lpSupply != 0) {
            uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());


            uint256 pointReward =
                blockMultiplier *
                pointsPerBlock *
                pool.allocPoint /
                totalAllocPoint;


            accPointsPerShare = pointReward *
                1e18 /
                lpSupply +
                accPointsPerShare;
        }


        return user.amount *
            accPointsPerShare /
            1e36 +
            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;
    }

```
We see of `accPointsPerShare` field of pool is not updated in regular intervals , the pendingPoints method will give incorrect 

rewards amount leading to loss of rewards to users when the amount of airdrop is based on the pending points

### PoC

Following PoC demonstrates that if updatePool is not called frequently , the calculated accPointsPerShare for specific pool 

can be as little as zero 

Insert these two functions inside `test/SophonFarming.t.sol` after setup method 
```solidity

    // @param updateByKeeper - True means no exploit - pools are updated by keepers after every block , False means exploit scenario
    function test_PointsNotAccrued(bool updateByKeeper) public {
        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        // pools will be update with massUpdatePools() inside these
        // changing end block number because for the already set maxuint-1000 , there's an overflow at the end block
        // when updating the pool
        sophonFarming.setEndBlock(1000000, 1000);
        harnessImplementation.setEndBlock(1000000, 1000);
        sophonFarming.setPointsPerBlock(pointsPerBlock);

        // ... insert any set function calls that set different params and update all pools

        // however , after the transaction initiated ,
        // the most practical function is `setEndBlock` which for sure will not be even called every block
        // to update the pool  `accPointsPerShare`

        // imagine everything is settled and platform starts rolling

        // including deposits ,withdrawls and all
        // but no one is interested to waste their gas by updating pools via massUpdatePools and updatePool
        // the accountin will be stale at the end

        address[] memory accounts = new address[](3);
        accounts[0] = account1;
        accounts[1] = account2;
        accounts[2] = account3;

        address keeper = vm.addr(76);

        // get config

        uint _startBlock = sophonFarming.startBlock();
        uint _endBlock = sophonFarming.endBlock();

        console.log("start block is ", _startBlock);
        console.log("end block is ", _endBlock);

        // ########### Activity part here , user deposits , keeper updates pools etc.

        vm.roll(_startBlock + 10);

        // make a deposit
        uint256 amountToDeposit1 = 100e18;
        uint256 poolId1 = sophonFarming.typeToId(
            SophonFarmingState.PredefinedPool.wstETH
        );

        // roll block to 10 more blocks to get some points unlocked i.e block multiplier
        vm.roll(block.number + 10);

        // keeper updates pools accounting

        if (updateByKeeper) {
            vm.startPrank(keeper);
            sophonFarming.updatePool(poolId1);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        // fetching user info
        (IERC20 lpToken, , , , , , , uint accPointsPerShare, ) = sophonFarming
            .poolInfo(poolId1);
        console.log("accPointsPerShare before deposit", accPointsPerShare);

        // ########## User deposit
        vm.startPrank(account1);
        deal(address(wstETH), account1, amountToDeposit1);
        wstETH.approve(address(sophonFarming), amountToDeposit1);
        sophonFarming.deposit(poolId1, amountToDeposit1, 0);

        // roll block to 10 more blocks to get some points unlocked
        vm.roll(block.number + 10);

        // keeper updates pools accounting
        if (updateByKeeper) {
            vm.startPrank(keeper);
            sophonFarming.updatePool(poolId1);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        // fetch pool details

        (lpToken, , , , , , , accPointsPerShare, ) = sophonFarming.poolInfo(
            poolId1
        );
        console.log("accPointsPerShare after deposit", accPointsPerShare);

        // update pool
        vm.roll(block.number + 10);

        // keeper updates pools accounting
        if (updateByKeeper) {
            vm.startPrank(keeper);
            sophonFarming.updatePool(poolId1);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }
        // fetch pool details

        (lpToken, , , , , , , accPointsPerShare, ) = sophonFarming.poolInfo(
            poolId1
        );
        console.log(
            "accPointsPerShare after update at startBlock",
            accPointsPerShare
        );

        // roll block number to  to end block - 10
        vm.roll(_endBlock - 10);

        // keeper updates pools accounting
        if (updateByKeeper) {
            vm.startPrank(keeper);
            sophonFarming.updatePool(poolId1);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        // fetch pool details

        (lpToken, , , , , , , accPointsPerShare, ) = sophonFarming.poolInfo(
            poolId1
        );

        if (updateByKeeper) {
            assert((accPointsPerShare>0 || accPointsPerShare == 83330750000000000000000) );
        } else {
            assert(accPointsPerShare== 0);
        }

    }

    function test_pointsAccrualScenario() public {
        // keepers are unavailable - attack scenario
        test_PointsNotAccrued(false);
        // If keepers are executing pool updates after every block
        test_PointsNotAccrued(true);
    }
```

The PoC code is well commented with the scenario and execution 

### PoC output
In our scenario , if keepers don't call update pool frequently or not at all after start block , the rewards will be zero 

and `>0 or 83330750000000000000000` if they do update 

```solidity
   if (updateByKeeper) {
            assert((accPointsPerShare>0 || accPointsPerShare == 83330750000000000000000) );
        } else {
            assert(accPointsPerShare== 0);
        }
```

if `accPointsPerShare=0` this will lead to a zero pending points to all the initial depositors who has staked nearly the startBlock

and this number `accPointsPerShare` can be very large and lead to proper rewards/pendingPoints calculation if keepers

are updating pools frequently.

### Why A Valid issue ?
As the issue `Causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states, or a loss is highly constrained. The losses must exceed small, finite amount of funds`

the issue is valid according to sherlock rules.


## Impact
Potential loss of pending points / airdrop rewards to users/

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Inside `pendingPoints` , call `updatePool(p_id)` to update the latest accounting for user's pool.
