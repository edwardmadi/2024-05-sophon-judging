# `depositSteth()` and `depositeEth()` will revert

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol always assumes that the amount of tokens received is equal to the amount of tokens transferred. 
This is not the case for rebasing tokens, such as `stETH` and `eETH`, because internally they transfer shares which generally results in the received amount of tokens being lower than the requested one by a couple of wei because of roundings: transferring `1e18` `eETH` tokens from A to B, will result in B receiving `0.99e18` `eETH` tokens.

Sophon deals with rebasing token transfers in 3 functions:
- [depositSteth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L473)
- [depositeEth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L488)
- [deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L443)

As an example the [depositeEth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L488) takes as input an `amount` of `eETH` to deposit, then:
1. Transfers `amount` of `eETH` from the caller to the contract itself
2. Wraps `amount` of `eETH` to `weETH`, which will attempt to transfer `amount` from the contract to the Etherfi protocol.

Step `2` will fail, because the contract doesn't have enough `eETH`. The issue lies in attempting to wrap `amount` of `eETH` in step `2` instead of wrapping the actual amount of tokens received. 

This also applies to the other two functions listed above, [depositSteth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L473) and [deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L443) (if a `stETH` and/or `eETH` pool exists).

## Impact

The functions [depositSteth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L473) and [depositeEth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L488) will revert.

## Recommendation
In [depositSteth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L473), [depositeEth()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L488) and [deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L443) deposit the actual amount of tokens received instead of the amount specified as input.
