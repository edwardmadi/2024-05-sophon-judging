# Delayed withdraw transaction will lead to accruing less rewards/points to users when the points per block has been changed in the meanwhile

## Summary
If a user initiates their withdraw transaction , the transaction gets delayed to next block but the transactions like decreasing the 

points per block by admin succeeds , the user will incur a huge loss of rewards/points that effectively will decrease amount of 

airdrop tokens amount the user is entitled to get.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Withdraw and deposit transactions rely on the block multiplier and points per block to calculate the amount of rewards/points 

settled for user . These rewards will be later used for deciding the exact amount of tokens the owner of the airdrop tokens

will send to the user and regarded as activity.

However , if a user initiates their withdraw transaction at Block X , and their transaction is delayed upto X+Y blocks where Y >=1

But in the same block X , there are set of owner only transactions that alter the state of farming contracts especially points per block

Then the user , when withdraw transaction is executed will incur a loss of funds compared to their anticipated rewards calculation.

The transaction delays are well known on ETH Mainnet & can occur due to following reasons : 

            - Network congestion scenarios 
            - Low gas fee for tx 
            - Random choice of block proposers

and some other miscellaneous factors.

Please read the well-detailed-documented PoC 
### PoC

 #### Exploit Scenario
1. User Deposits amount
2. After some blocks , User initiates the withdraw tx , it goes into mempool , Tx is delayed due to one of the following reasons 
            - network congestion scenarios 
            - low gas fee for tx 
            - random choice of block proposers
            - some other miscelenious factors
3. Points per block and some other parameters related to rewards accumulation are modified by owner 
4. User's withdraw is executed one block after the intended current block
5. User's rewardsSettled are manipulated to have less rewards than anticipated.

This test demonstrates how this small delay in witdraw tx can lead to user losing their 8.33e18 Tokens which is huge amount of rewards.

The issue might escalate when their is a big price change in pointsPerBlock and transaction delays for more blocks like 5 or 10 

in the time of high network demand.

## Impact
Loss of user's rewards/points which effectively means loss of token funds as they will determine the amount of airdrop tokens
users will receive.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There can be multiple steps to minimize ( as fixing is very hard - would require revamping entire implementation )

- Allow time-boxed change of critical params like points per block and other params that affect's the accounting price per share .
