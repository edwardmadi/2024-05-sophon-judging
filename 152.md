# Wrong Configuration for dai and sDAI Leads to Malfunction of Protocol's Functions

## Summary
In the `initialize` function,  It calls poolExists[dai] = true, while the correct one should be `poolExists[sDai]`; 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the **constructor** function, the deployer passes in an array of addresses to set both dai and sDai as immutable variables:

later on in the `initialize`, a mapping `poolExists` is modified:

## Impact

1. An additional sDai pool can be add (should not be allowed by masterChef):

2. Not able run the set function to update allocPoint
