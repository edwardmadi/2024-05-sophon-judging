# `SophonFarming::withdraw()` and `SophonFarming::deposit()` lack reentrancy protection, which can cause reward emission issues if tokens allow for transfer flow control

## Summary

All deposit, withdraw and staking-related functions are susceptible to reentrancy, especially if ERC777 tokens are added to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L443

Both the `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions do not follow the Check-Effect-Interact pattern having core logic defined after the external calls when doing token transfers. If tokens allows for the control of transfer call flow or can be upgraded to allow it in the future (i.e. have or can introduce the _beforetokentransfer, _afterTokenTransfer type of hooks; or, say, can be upgraded to ERC777), the current implementation makes it possible to incorrectly alter the reward calculations of the contract by directly reentering deposit() or withdraw() with tiny _amounts.

## Impact

This vulnerability could lead to improper reward calculation, which could result in a loss of funds for the users.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _pid, uint256 _withdrawAmount) external {
    ...SNIP...

    pool.lpToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _withdrawAmount);

@>    user.rewardDebt = userAmount *  // reward debt calculation after the external call
                    pool.accPointsPerShare /
                1e18;

    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _pid, _withdrawAmount);
}
```

```solidity
   function deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount, uint256 _boostAmount) external {
    poolInfo[_pid].lpToken.safeTransferFrom(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        _amount
    );

@>    _deposit(_pid, _amount, _boostAmount); // all of the deposit logic is after the external call

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, _pid, _amount, _boostAmount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a direct reentrancy control, e.g. [nonReentrant](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/utils#ReentrancyGuard) modifier.

Also, consider finishing all internal state updates prior to external calls, check [this guide](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/reentrancy/#pitfalls-in-reentrancy-solutions).
