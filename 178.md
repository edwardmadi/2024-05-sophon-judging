# Missing Current Stake Limit check will revert the whole `_ethTOstEth()` function

## Summary
While staking eth into lido using `_ethTOstEth()`  there are no checks in place to validate whether the current staking limit has been reached or not prior to staking funds onto `Lido`. Call will revert leading to DoS

## Vulnerability Detail
In `SophonFarming.sol` whenever a user calls [depositEth](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L503) or [depositwETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L524) functions, it internally calls the `_ethTOstEth` function  to stake the supplied `ETH` into `Lido` protocol. 
[SophonFarming.sol#L8085](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L808)

```js
  function _ethTOstEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // submit function does not return exact amount of stETH so we need to check balances
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
        IstETH(stETH).submit{value: _amount}(address(this));
        return (IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);
    }
```

`Lido` implements a daily staking limit on the amount of ETH that can be staked as per their docs. Accordingly the daily rate is 150000 ETH and the `_ethTOstEth()` function will revert if the limit is hit. From the [docs](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/steth-integration-guide/#staking-rate-limits):

> Staking rate limits In order to handle the staking surge in case of some unforeseen market conditions, the Lido protocol implemented staking rate limits aimed at reducing the surge's impact on the staking queue & Lidoâ€™s socialized rewards distribution model. There is a sliding window limit that is parametrized with _maxStakingLimit and _stakeLimitIncreasePerBlock. This means it is only possible to submit this much ether to the Lido staking contracts within a 24 hours timeframe. Currently, the daily staking limit is set at 150,000 ether. You can picture this as a health globe from Diablo 2 with a maximum of _maxStakingLimit and regenerating with a constant speed per block. When you deposit ether to the protocol, the level of health is reduced by its amount and the current limit becomes smaller and smaller. When it hits the ground, transaction gets reverted. To avoid that, you should check if getCurrentStakeLimit() >= amountToStake, and if it's not you can go with an alternative route. The staking rate limits are denominated in ether, thus, it makes no difference if the stake is being deposited for stETH or using the wstETH shortcut, the limits apply in both cases.

However, there are no checks in place to validate whether the current staking limit has been reached or not prior to staking funds onto `Lido`

## Impact
As a result, `_ethTOstEth()` function will revert leading to DoS.

## Recommendation
```js
       function _ethTOstEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256){
        uint256 stakeLimit = IstETH(stETH).getCurrentStakeLimit();
          if (_amount > stakeLimit) {
            // Cap stake amount
           _amount = stakeLimit;
          }
        // submit function does not return exact amount of stETH so we need to check balances
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
        IstETH(stETH).submit{value: _amount}(address(this));
        return (IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);
    }
```
