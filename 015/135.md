# EETH Deposits Would Be Non-Functional If WhiteListing Is Turned On

## Summary

Note this is unrelated to if external admins are trusted , this is a feature which can be toggled in the EETH Liquidity Pool Contract . If
whitelisting is turned on on the EETH liquidity pool then it would make the deposit to the weETH pool impossible (via depositing ETH or WETH) since it would always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.) The farming period has begun and users can now deposit to earn rewards.

2.) User holds ETH/WETH and wants to deposit into the weETH pool.

3.) Calls `depositEth` here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L503

4.) Since the user wants to deposit into the weETH pool , this code snippet would trigger 

```solidity
} else if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.weETH) {
            _finalAmount = _ethTOeEth(_finalAmount);
        }
```

which triggers , 

```solidity
function _ethTOeEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // deposit returns exact amount of eETH
        return IeETHLiquidityPool(eETHLiquidityPool).deposit{value: _amount}(address(this));
    }
```

5.) In the deposit function of the eETH Liquidity pool contract here https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/smart-contracts/blob/master/src/LiquidityPool.sol#L148  , it would revert if the whitelisting mechanism has been turned on by the eETH team.

Therefore , a user trying to deposit into the weETH pool would encounter a DoS and this breaks a core functionality of the contract.


## Impact

 A user trying to deposit into the weETH pool would encounter a DoS and this breaks a core functionality of the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

These kind of risks should be acknowledged , also alt solution can be to re-route the deposit into the wstETH pool in such case.
