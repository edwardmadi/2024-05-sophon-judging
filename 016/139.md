# Inability to start Farming

## Summary
The  `setStartBlock ` function allows setting the starting block for a farming period, but the current implementation might lead to unexpected reverts.
## Vulnerability Detail
During initial contract deployment, setting a valid `startBlock `might be impossible due to the check against the current `block number`. This could prevent proper configuration of the farming period as `startBlock` will be 0 which will make the transaction revert every time 
## Impact
* The primary purpose of the `setStartBlock` function is to define the starting point for the farming period.
* Due to the flawed check against the current block number, setting a valid `startBlock` in the future (relative to deployment) might be impossible. This essentially prevents users from initiating the farming process altogether practically making the whole contract unusable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are a couple of options here :
*  ### Invert the Condition
We can change the `getBlockNumber() > startBlock` to
```solidity
if (getBlockNumber() >_startBlock) {
            revert FarmingIsStarted();
}
```
this way it will make sure that `startBlock` will start in a future block instead of past one

* ### Handle Initial Deployment
```solidity
if (_startBlock == 0 || (endBlock != 0 && _startBlock >= endBlock)) {
  revert InvalidStartBlock();
} else if (startBlock == 0) {
  // Allow setting startBlock during initial deployment
} else if (startBlock <= getBlockNumber()) {
  revert FarmingIsStarted();
}
```
