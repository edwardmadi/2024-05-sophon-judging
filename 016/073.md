# Allowing Setting startBlock to a Past Block in `SophonFarming::setStartBlock` Enables Premature Farming Start

## Summary
The function `SophonFarming::setStartBlock` does not prevent the `startBlock` from being set to a past block, which could result in logical inconsistencies or unintended behavior. This could potentially disrupt the intended functionality of time-based operations in the contract.

## Code Snippet

## Impact

The owner of the contract could maliciously set the `startBlock` to a past block.

## Vulnerability Detail

This could cause the farming process (or any time-dependent mechanism) to start immediately or at an unintended time, bypassing the actual intended start logic. For example, if rewards are distributed based on block numbers, setting the `startBlock` in the past could manipulate the reward distribution process.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```diff
+        if (getBlockNumber() > _startBlock) {
+            revert InvalidStartBlock();
+        }

```
