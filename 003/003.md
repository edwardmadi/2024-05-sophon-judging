# Lack of Slippage protection in `depositEth` can lead to loss of funds

## Summary
The `depositEth` method converts `ETH` to `stETH` , however , it forgets to account for the slippage protection while 

conversion because it is assumed that stETH is almost equal to eth in value in the market however its not true.

2 years ago , stETH has deviated by a large factor of 5% from its eth value 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `receive` method of the sophon farming contract is designed to allow direct exchange of eth to stETH

```solidity

    /**
     * @notice Allows direct deposits of ETH for deposit to the wstETH pool
     */
    receive() external payable {
        if (msg.sender == weth) {
            return;
        }

        depositEth(0, PredefinedPool.wstETH);
    }
```
And that deposit method is here

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L503-L516


The deposit method exchanges the amount of eth sent to stETH and deposits for the caller.

If deposit type of `wstETH` , this function is called.


```solidity
    function _ethTOstEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // submit function does not return exact amount of stETH so we need to check balances
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
        IstETH(stETH).submit{value: _amount}(address(this));
        return (IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);
    }
```

This function does not ensure any slippage protection , rather it just fetches the traded amount of stETH for ETH 

and deposits to user's account using `_depositPredefinedAsset` method.

However , due to lack of slippage protection , system is vulnerable to acquire less deposited amount 

for the user who might not accept the devastating market conditions.

In deposit , ETH is converted to stETH and then that is converted to some other asset , 

but if stETH behaves very volatilely, and its price goes above the eth price , the depositors might receive 

less deposited amount in their account .

Just take an example ,

Here are the current market rates of 

##### stETH

##### ETH

Similar incident has happened in the past 

where `stETH` price has dropped a lot - by a factor of `5%` .

## `stETH` Deviated by 5%

The significant deviation of stETH from ETH, where stETH's price fell below ETH's, happened in the aftermath of the `Terra/Luna de-peg crisis` in `May 2022`. This event led to a series of market reactions that resulted in stETH trading at a discount compared to ETH, a scenario that had not been observed since `March 2021`. The price deviation reached its peak on `June 10, 2022`, with `stETH trading at 0.9474 ETH`, representing a `slippage of about 5%`. This discrepancy was primarily due to large exits from stETH positions by notable entities like `Alameda Research and Celsius Network`, which significantly impacted the liquidity and balance of the Curve `stETH/ETH pool`.

### Reference
[stETH vs ETH Price Deviations](https://jp12.medium.com/steth-vs-eth-price-deviations-25877c66c3d0)

### PoC

So taking the above listed event where price of stETH has deviated by a factor of 5%,

imagine `ETH price is 3683$`
stETH = 0.9474 ETH = 0.9474 *3683$ = 3489$

Difference in price =194$

if a user deposits 100 ETH 
stETH amount obtained is = 0.9474*100 = 94.7ETH 

value of stETH obtained = 97.4 * 3683 = 358724 $ 


```solidity
    function _ethTOstEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
        // submit function does not return exact amount of stETH so we need to check balances
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
        IstETH(stETH).submit{value: _amount}(address(this));
        return (IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);
    }
```

Now `_depositPredefinedAsset` is called in following way 

  _depositPredefinedAsset(_finalAmount, msg.value, _boostAmount, _predefinedPool);

which is 

  _depositPredefinedAsset(97.4  stETH, 100 eth, 0, wstETH);

`_boostAmount` is 0 because receive method pass it as zero .

```solidity

   function _depositPredefinedAsset(uint256 _amount, uint256 _initalAmount, uint256 _boostAmount, PredefinedPool _predefinedPool) internal {

        uint256 _finalAmount;

        if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.sDAI) {
            _finalAmount = _daiTOsDai(_amount);
        } else if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.wstETH) {
            _finalAmount = _stEthTOwstEth(_amount);
        } else if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.weETH) {
            _finalAmount = _eethTOweEth(_amount);
        } else {
            revert InvalidDeposit();
        }

        // adjust boostAmount for the new asset
        _boostAmount = _boostAmount * _finalAmount / _initalAmount;

        _deposit(typeToId[_predefinedPool], _finalAmount, _boostAmount);
    }
```

following branch will be executed 

```solidity
else if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.wstETH) {
            _finalAmount = _stEthTOwstEth(_amount);
```

For simplicity , assume that a token's wrapped version is almost equal to it to focus more on our main issue.

Now `_finalAmount=97.4  wstETH`

where boostAmount will again be zero 

```solidity
    // adjust boostAmount for the new asset
        _boostAmount = _boostAmount * _finalAmount / _initalAmount;

```
Now the call to deposit happens

```solidity
_deposit(typeToId[_predefinedPool], _finalAmount, _boostAmount);
        
// translates to following 

_deposit(wstETH_ID, 97.4  wstETH , 0)
```

And then the `_deposit` method  just updates the balances of the user

```solidity
    user.depositAmount = user.depositAmount + _depositAmount;
   
```

So transaction succeeeds.

Now when the user checks their deposited amount in the protocol , 

they have a balance of  `97.4  wstETH`  in exchange for `100 ETH`

incurring a loss of `2.6 ETH` = 9.5k$` which is huge for a user living in diversified contries

let's say if this loss if incurred by someone living in iran ,

This loss would mean a `Loss of 400 Million Rupees`.

Which is significant .


### Issue Validity according to Sherlock

As this issue clearly shows `a definite loss of funds with a detailed explanation for the same can be considered valid high`
So i believe its a valid High severity issue.

## Impact
Lack of slippage protection can lead to depositing eth at unfair market conditions leading to Huge loss of funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `deadline` and `minAmount` and `maxAmount` like parameters to the deposit method according

to your threat minimizing scheme for the protocol.
