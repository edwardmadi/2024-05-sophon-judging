# ETH deposits into SophonFarming via `wstETH` pools is made at a loss to the user

## Summary
The lack of slippage control for `IwstETH(wstETH).wrap()` function can lead to a substantial loss of assets (yield) and points for the affected users.

## Vulnerability Detail
User call `SophonFarming::depositEth(...)` with the `_predefinedPool` set as `PredefinedPool.wstETH` to make deposit into a LIDO `wstETH/stETH` pool in exchange for the `wstETH` tokens by calling `_stEthTOwstEth(...)` which makes an external call to ether.fi liquidity pool `submit(...)` function which then cached the `stETH` amount received in the `_finalAmount `variable and it goes further to convert the stETH to wstETH by calling the `IwstETH(wstETH).wrap(_amount)` to get `wstETh.


```solidity
File: SophonFarming.sol
533:        if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.wstETH) {
534:             _finalAmount = _ethTOstEth(_finalAmount);
535:         }
...

808:     function _ethTOstEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
809:         // submit function does not return exact amount of stETH so we need to check balances
810:         uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
811:         IstETH(stETH).submit{value: _amount}(address(this));
812:         return (IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);
813:     }


825:         // @audit _depositPredefinedAsset(...) assumes 1 : 1 peg for stETH : wstETH this can break the accounting of the 
826:         // @audit protocol since today 20/05/2024 there a 12% in their exchange rate (owing to market volaity that stemed from the rumors around SEC approval of ETH ETF)
827:         // @audit SUGGESTION: add a slippage protection to ensure Sophon does not recieve less than a particular number of shares
...
821:     function _stEthTOwstEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
822:         // wrap returns exact amount of wstETH
823:         return IwstETH(wstETH).wrap(_amount);
824:     }


```

The movement of funds is in the order and ratio shown below
```solidity
-- ETH -> stETH       ............................ ~1:0.989
-- stETH-> wstETH      ............................ ~ 1:0.8565

```

However,  the ether.fi `wstETH/eETH` pool does not exchange eETH for wstETH at a 1:1 ratio and at the time of writing this report 23/05/2024 
the price of stETH = $3860 while 
price of wstETH = $4504
1$ = 1 / 4504 wstETH
1$ = 1 / 3845 stETH
1 eETH = 3845 / 4504 wstETH
1 eETH = 0.8536856128 ETH

In fact as of 20/05/2024 when the SEC released [this](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-sec-asks-exchanges-fine-tune-ether-etf-filings-positive-sign-approval-say-2024-05-21/) news, the eETh/wstETh exchange rate was 1:0.8276

As you can see wstETH/stETH has periods of wild fluctuations and Depeg of over 5.5%
Having said that, the amount of wstETH tokens received will vary (smaller than expected)

In a nutshell, the `IwstETH(wstETH).wrap(...)` function lacks the slippage control that allows the users to revert if the minimum amount amount of `wstETH` they received is less than the amount they expected to deposit and earn points for.

- Alice deposits 100ETH (indicating `_boostAmount` = 0 with the intent of increasing boost after deposit) but the `IwstETH(wstETH).wrap(...)` function returns 84.96.9eETH (considering the loss from ETH/stETH exchange)as her investment.
- she later calls increaseBoost(...) with the max amount of boost she can get, she will loose  yield and points worth over 5 wstETH cummulative because the 
- 100ETH of deposit will not give 100wstETH worth of returns to Alice

## Impact
Users deposit into the ether.fi wstETH/stETH pool without slippage checks leading to loss of funds

Likelyhood = High
Impact = High

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add a slippage check to ensure the slippage is controlled

- Or refactor the code to only use wstETH which avoids single sided exposure which creates further issues in the protocol
