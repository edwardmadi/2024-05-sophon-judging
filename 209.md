# DOS in depositEth Function due to Reentrancy

## Summary
The `depositEth` function in the SophonFarming contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy issue that can cause the contract to run out of gas and revert, leading to a potential denial of service.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the following sequence of events:

-> Initial Call to depositEth:

A user calls depositEth with a specified _boostAmount and PredefinedPool.wstETH.The function checks if msg.value is zero and reverts if true.
The _ethTOstEth function is called to convert ETH to stETH.

-> Conversion to stETH:
Inside _ethTOstEth, the balance of stETH before the conversion is recorded.The submit function of the Lido protocol is called, which sends stETH tokens to the contract.
The submit function triggers the receive function of the SophonFarming contract.

-> Reentrancy via receive Function:
```solidity

receive() external payable {
        if (msg.sender == weth) {
            return;
        }

        depositEth(0, PredefinedPool.wstETH);
    }

```
The receive function checks if the sender is weth and returns if true.Otherwise, it calls depositEth again with msg.value and PredefinedPool.wstETH.
This reentrant call to depositEth repeats the process, leading to an loop.

## Impact

Denial of Service: The reentrancy loop can cause the contract to run out of gas, leading to a denial of service. Although the attacker cannot directly benefit financially from this, it can disrupt the normal operation of the contract.
