# `massUpdatePools()` is susceptible to DoS with block gas limit

## Summary
The `massUpdatePools()` function in `SophonFarming.sol` poses a susceptibility to DoS due to its unbounded loop, which iterates over all the pools stored in the poolInfo array. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In `SophonFarming.sol`, `massUpdatePools()` is a public function which typically iterates over all the pools stored in the `poolInfo` array and updates each pool's state by calling the  `updatePool()` function for the length of `poolInfo`. Hence, it is an unbounded loop, depending on the length of `poolInfo`. 
If `poolInfo.length` is big enough i.e. if there are large number of pools, block gas limit may be hit.

```js
    function massUpdatePools() public {
        uint256 length = poolInfo.length;
        for(uint256 pid = 0; pid < length;) {
            updatePool(pid);
            unchecked { ++pid; }
        }
    }
```

## Impact
If pools are not updated due to the block gas limit being reached, they may retain a stale state, potentially leading to inaccurate or outdated information regarding the current status of the pools.

## Recommendation
 refactor the `massUpdatePools()` function to avoid the risk of hitting the block gas limit.
