# In `SophonFarming::massUpdatePools` function can be DoS with gas limit

## Summary
The issue that the `massUpdatePools`  can hit block gas limit if the length of the `poolInfo` became too big.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue that the `massUpdatePools` is a public function and it calls the `updatePool` function for the length of the `poolInfo`. Since it depends on the length of the `poolInfo` if the length became too big it can hit block gas limit.

## Impact
At some point the protocol would be unable to do mass update since `massUpdatePools` cannot execute due to the gas limit, so one of the important protocol functions (updating multiple pools) cannot be done.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L399C1-L405C6
```javascript
    function massUpdatePools() public {
        uint256 length = poolInfo.length;
        for(uint256 pid = 0; pid < length;) {
            updatePool(pid);
            unchecked { ++pid; }
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The protocol can limit the max number of loop iterations by limiting amount of pools that can be added for example.
