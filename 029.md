# incorrect-equality - contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol -> L574-L624

# Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol -> L574-L624

An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability by manipulating the value of _depositAmount to be equal to 0, which would bypass certain checks or conditions in the _deposit function. This could lead to unintended behavior or allow the attacker to perform unauthorized actions within the SophonFarming contract.

## Impact
Medium Impact 

## Code Snippet
farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L574-L624

```
    /**
     * @notice Deposit an asset to SophonFarming
     * @param _pid pid of the deposit
     * @param _depositAmount amount of the deposit
     * @param _boostAmount amount to boost
     */
    function _deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _depositAmount, uint256 _boostAmount) internal {
        if (isFarmingEnded()) {
            revert FarmingIsEnded();
        }
        if (_depositAmount == 0) {
            revert InvalidDeposit();
        }
        if (_boostAmount > _depositAmount) {
            revert BoostTooHigh(_depositAmount);
        }

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The vulnerability in the code snippet lies in the use of strict equality (==) to check if _depositAmount is equal to 0. This can be dangerous as it can be manipulated by an attacker. To rectify this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a comparison operator (<=) instead of strict equality.

By changing the line if (_depositAmount == 0) to if (_depositAmount <= 0), you ensure that the function checks if _depositAmount is greater than or equal to 0, which is a safer way to handle the condition and prevents potential manipulation by an attacker.
```
    /**
     * @notice Deposit an asset to SophonFarming
     * @param _pid pid of the deposit
     * @param _depositAmount amount of the deposit
     * @param _boostAmount amount to boost
     */
    function _deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _depositAmount, uint256 _boostAmount) internal {
        if (isFarmingEnded()) {
            revert FarmingIsEnded();
        }
        if (_depositAmount <= 0) {
            revert InvalidDeposit();
        }
        if (_boostAmount > _depositAmount) {
            revert BoostTooHigh(_depositAmount);
        }
```
