# Less rewards than `_pointsPerBlock` will be distributed each block as long as there's a single pool without stakers

## Summary


## Vulnerability Detail

SophonFarming is supposed to mint `_pointsPerBlock` rewards each block. Each block, each pool receives `_pointsPerBlock * allocPoint / totalAllocPoint` rewards, where `totalAllocPoint` is the sum of all pool's `allocPoints`.

Once a pool is added, but does not have any stakers yet, total weight of other pools decreases, but new pool's rewards [are not accounted for anyone](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L419-L422), so reward emission rate temporarily becomes smaller than `_pointsPerBlock`.

It is especially likely to happen with pools added after `startBlock`, as it may take some time before users notice a new pool and decide to stake in it.

## Proof of Concept

1. There's 2 empty pools: A and B; `_allocPointA = 100`, `_allocPointB = 100`.
2. Alice stakes in pool A, Bob stakes in pool B.

3. Farming starts. Each block Alice receives `_pointsPerBlock / 2` as the only staker of A; same for Bob and B.

4. Pool C is added,  `_allocPointC = 100`.

Until someone stakes in pool C (which may take few minutes or hours), Alice will be receiving 1/3 of `_pointsPerBlock`, Bob will be receiving another 1/3, and the remaining 1/3 will not be accounted for anyone, therefore emission rate of rewards will be lower than intended.

## Impact

Less rewards than `_pointsPerBlock` will be distributed between stakers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Pool's `_allocPoint` should be included in `totalAllocPoint` only as long as that pool's `lpSupply` is positive.
