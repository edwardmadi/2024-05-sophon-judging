# `pointsPerBlock` Can Be Set to Zero During Initialization

## Summary
The `pointsPerBlock` variable can be set to zero during the `initialization` of the contract, which would effectively halt the distribution of rewards.
## Vulnerability Detail
During the `initialize` function, there is no check to ensure that the `_pointsPerBlock` parameter is greater than zero. This could result in the `pointsPerBlock` being set to zero, which would stop reward distribution and affect the entire farming mechanism. although it can be changed later using 'setPointsPerBlock' function, it will cost extra gas , so its better to have a validation for `pointsPerBlock` during initialization itself
## Impact
If `pointsPerBlock` is set to `zero`, no rewards will be distributed to users, rendering the farming functionality ineffective and potentially causing significant financial loss and user dissatisfaction.

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that `_pointsPerBlock` is greater than `zero` during the initialization process.
