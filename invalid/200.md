# Improper storage slot management in proxy contract causes potential overwriting of critical variables

## Summary
The proxy and implementation contracts may face issues due to the direct storage of the **`implementation`** address in a common storage slot. This approach lacks the safeguards recommended by EIP-1967, potentially leading to storage collisions with the implementation contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The implementation address is set in the constructor of the **`Proxy2Step`** contract and stored using the **`implementation`** variable from the **`Upgradeable2Step`** contract. This method of storing the implementation address does not protect against storage collisions, which can occur if the implementation contract inadvertently uses the same storage slots as the proxy, particularly during upgrades or when extending functionality.
## Impact
Storage collisions between the proxy and its implementation can lead to unpredictable behavior, including overwriting critical variables. This could compromise the integrity of the contract's logic, lead to loss of funds, or cause disruption in the protocol's operation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the risk of storage collisions in a transparent proxy setup:

- Adopt EIP-1967 Standard: Modify the storage of critical administrative variables like **`implementation`** to use specific, pre-determined storage slots based on hashed identifiers. This helps ensure that these slots will not collide with those used by the implementation contracts.
- Manage Storage Layout Carefully: Ensure that during contract upgrades, both the proxy and implementation maintain a consistent and non-overlapping storage layout.

**`Upgradeable2Step` Contract:**

```diff

    // The existing becomeImplementation function is fine as it checks the owner and then calls acceptImplementation

```

**`Proxy2Step` Contract:**

    // Proxy fallback function using the implementation address from the EIP-1967 slot
    fallback() external virtual payable {
        assembly {
