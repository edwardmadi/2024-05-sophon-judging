# User can `deposit` assets before farming started ie `startBlock`

## Summary
User can `deposit` assets before farming started ie `startBlock` as there is no checks  which will lead to immediate `rewardSettled`

## Vulnerability Detail
Assets are `deposited` in the protocol through all the deposits functions. Also there is `no check` if the farming is started or not.
```solidity
function _deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _depositAmount, uint256 _boostAmount) internal {
        if (isFarmingEnded()) {
            revert FarmingIsEnded();
        }
        if (_depositAmount == 0) {
            revert InvalidDeposit();
        }
        if (_boostAmount > _depositAmount) {
            revert BoostTooHigh(_depositAmount);
        }
      .....
    }
```
A malicious actor can deposit before `startBlock` and will immediately have `rewardSettled` when farming is started


## Impact
Malicious actor can game the `rewardSettled`

## Tool used
Manual Review  + VS Code

## Recommendation
`Don't` allow depositing assets `before` farming started
