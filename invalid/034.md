# `_pendingPoints` returns more points than the user will actually receive

## Summary

Internal function `_pendingPoints` is used by multiple view functions to retrieve the amount of rewards the user received for staking. There points are supposed to represent amount of SOPH each user will receive.

However, `_pendingPoints` uses a slightly different formula for computing the rewards in comparison to state-changing functions, and will return a value slightly different than the "real" one.

## Vulnerability Detail

[_pendingPoints](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L373-L383) adds `accPointsPerShare * 18` and `pointReward * 1e18 / lpSupply`, and then divides the result by 1e36.

[other functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L587-L595) use `updatePool`, which adds `accPointsPerShare` and `pointReward / lpSupply`, and then divide the result by 1e18.

Therefore, the former will have higher precision and return a slightly higher value. 

## Impact

View functions that return users' pending points will return a value higher than the actual one. As it is the only function that allows to retrieve users' accumulated rewards, and is going to be used for determining amount of SOPH to mint, it will result in slightly too many SOPH being minted.
