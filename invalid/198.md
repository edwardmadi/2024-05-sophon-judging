# Dangerous Proxy Pattern Implementation with Constructor and Immutable Variables Leading to Incompatibility

## Summary
The SophonFarming.sol contract uses a constructor with immutable variables, which is incompatible with the proxy pattern. Move state initialization to an initialize function to ensure proper setup via the proxy.


## Vulnerability Detail
The SophonFarming.sol contract currently uses a constructor to initialize immutable variables. This approach is incompatible with the proxy pattern used for upgradeable contracts. The constructor is executed only once when the implementation contract is deployed, and its state changes are not reflected in the proxy's storage. Additionally, immutable variables are stored in the bytecode, meaning their values are shared across all proxies pointing to the same implementation contract, which is not desirable.


## Impact
 Immutable Variables: Immutable variables set in the constructor are stored in the bytecode and shared across all proxies. This can lead to unintended behavior as each proxy should have its own state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure compatibility with the proxy pattern, remove the constructor and use an initializer function to set up the contract state. This function should be called after the proxy is deployed and points to the implementation contract.
