# Unnecessary Scaling in _pendingPoints() Function

## Summary
The `_pendingPoints()` function in the `SophonFarming.sol` contract used to get the points which is used to airdrop to users later. But, the `_pendingPoints()` function uses a different scaling mechanism other than `_deposit()` used, which results in points being calculated differently from the `_deposit()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies in the unnecessary scaling with in the `_pendingPoints()` function, which causes points to be calculated incorrectly compared to the `_deposit()` function.

Please see the code

```solidity
357:    function _pendingPoints(uint256 _pid, address _user) internal view returns (uint256) {
358:        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
359:        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user];
360:
361: @-->   uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;
362:
363:        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
364:        if (getBlockNumber() > pool.lastRewardBlock && lpSupply != 0) {
365:            uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());
366:
367:            uint256 pointReward =
368:                blockMultiplier *
369:                pointsPerBlock *
370:                pool.allocPoint /
371:                totalAllocPoint;
372:
373: @-->       accPointsPerShare = pointReward *
374:                1e18 /
375:                lpSupply +
376:                accPointsPerShare;
377:        }
378:        
379:            return user.amount *
380:            accPointsPerShare /
381: @-->       1e36 +
382:            user.rewardSettled -
383:            user.rewardDebt;
384:    }
```

Please see line 361 and 373, which is used a different scaling than `_deposit()` and in line 381 scaled down with 1e36 to balance the previous scaling but it should scaled dow with 1e18 too, Please see the `_deposit()`


## Impact
This issue can lead to discrepancies in the calculation of points, potentially affecting the accuracy of rewards earned by users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the unnecessary scaling with 1e18 in the _pendingPoints() function to ensure consistent calculation of points with the deposit() function.
