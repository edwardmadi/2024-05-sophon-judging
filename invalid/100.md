# Missing storage gap variable in Upgradable2Step

## Summary
For upgradeable contracts, there must be storage gap to “allow developers to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments” (quote OpenZeppelin).

## Vulnerability Detail

`Upgradable2Step` contract is missing `__gap[50]` storage variable to allow new storage variables. 

## Impact

The impact of storage collision can be severe, potentially leading to:

1. Data Loss: Important state variables could be overwritten, leading to loss of critical data.
2. Security Risks: Malicious actors could exploit storage collisions to manipulate contract states or steal assets.
3. Functionality Breakage: Contract functions relying on the overwritten data could fail or behave unexpectedly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend adding appropriate storage gap at the end of upgradeable contracts such as the below. Please reference OpenZeppelin upgradeable contract templates.
```javascript
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
