# Lack of validation for addresses passed in the `SophonFarming` constructor

## Summary
The constructor initializes immutable token addresses without validating if they are non-zero. If invalid token addresses are provided, it could lead to malfunctioning of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

If any of the token addresses are set to zero or an invalid address, the contract functions relying on these tokens will fail.

For instance, operations involving transfers or approvals with these tokens will revert, potentially halting contract functionality.

Zero or invalid token addresses can be exploited by attackers. For example, if a zero address is used, funds sent to this address can be irrecoverable.

```diff
    constructor(address[8] memory tokens_) {

+        require(tokens_[0] != address(0), "Invalid DAI address");
+        require(tokens_[1] != address(0), "Invalid sDAI address");
+        require(tokens_[2] != address(0), "Invalid WETH address");
+        require(tokens_[3] != address(0), "Invalid stETH address");
+        require(tokens_[4] != address(0), "Invalid wstETH address");
+        require(tokens_[5] != address(0), "Invalid eETH address");
+        require(tokens_[6] != address(0), "Invalid eETHLiquidityPool address");
+        require(tokens_[7] != address(0), "Invalid weETH address");
        dai = tokens_[0];
        sDAI = tokens_[1];
        weth = tokens_[2];
        stETH = tokens_[3];
        wstETH = tokens_[4];
        eETH = tokens_[5];
        eETHLiquidityPool = tokens_[6];
        weETH = tokens_[7];
    }
