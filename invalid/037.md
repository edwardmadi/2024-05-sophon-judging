# `pointsPerBlock` will not be updated if there is at least one pool with zero `lpSupply`

## Summary
In order to set the `pointsPerBlock` for the farming contract, the `owner` calls `SophonFarming::setPointsPerBlock(...)`. The `massUpdatePools()` function is compulsorily invoked before updating the `pointsPerBlock` to its new value. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L310-L316

The [`massUpdatePools()` function loops](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L401) over ALL the pools and calls the `updatePool(...)` for each of the pools. However, the `updatePool(...)` function returns and ends execution if it encounters any empty pool without updating the `pointsPerBlock`.
```solidity
File: SophonFarming.sol
411:     function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public {
412:         PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
413:         if (getBlockNumber() <= pool.lastRewardBlock) {
414:             return;
415:         }
416:         uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
417:         uint256 _pointsPerBlock = pointsPerBlock;
418:         uint256 _allocPoint = pool.allocPoint;
419:  @>     if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
420:             pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
421:  @>         return;
422:         }

```

## Vulnerability Detail

- Consider 3 pools lp1, lp2 and lp3 respectively with `lpSupply` 1000lp1, 0lp2, 1000lp3
- admin calls `setPointsPerBlock(...)`  to change its `pointsPerBlock` from 150 to 200
- as seen on `l419` above, the call to `setPointsPerBlock(...)` will return and end  because the `lpSupply` of lp2 is zero.
- hence the `pointsPerBlock` is not updated to 200


## Impact
- This breaks core protocol functionality as the `lp` supply of one pool affects the protocols core state update without reverting or notifying the admin
- This can also lead to leak of value for the user or the protocol depending on direction of the update (increasing / decreasing) `pointsPerBlock` value.

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
A trivial solution cannot be suggested for this one as the farming contract currently lacks a proper documentation. However, I will suggest implementing a different `massUpdatePools()` for the setter functions.
