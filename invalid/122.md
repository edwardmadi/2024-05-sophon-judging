# `_withUpdate` flag in `set()`/`add()` should not be optional if `startBlock` has already been reached

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions [add()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L153) and [set()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L195) both:
- Change the `totalAllocPoint` global parameter
- Change the `allocPoint` parameter of the specified pool 
- Allow a flag `_withUpdate` to decide if every existing pool `accPointsPerShare` should be updated

Both `totalAllocPoint` and `allocPoint` are parameters that have an impact on how points many points a pool can accumulate, as can be seen in the [updatePool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L424C1-L428C29) function. 

## Impact
If  [add()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L153) or [set()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L195) are called and `_withUpdate` is passed as `false` when the protocol `startBlock` has been reached (ie. the pools are already accumulating points) then the points calculations will be skewed. 

When `startBlock` has been reached pools should be updated no matter what, there is no reason to make it optional.

## Recommendation
Force both [add()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L153) and [set()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L195) to update the pools if `startBlock` has been reached:
```solidity
if (_withUpdate || block.number >= startBlock) {
    massUpdatePools();
}
```
