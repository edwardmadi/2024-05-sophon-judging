# `SophonFarming.set` can be frontrun with a call to `massUpdatePools` distributing rewards based on the old terms

## Summary
[SophonFarming.set()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L195-L216) updates the percent of the total rewards that a given pool should receive. This can be frontrun by a call to [massUpdatePools()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L399C1-L405C6) to distribute the accumulated rewards based on the current terms.
## Vulnerability Detail
Before changing the allocation points of the pool, `set()` optionally makes a call to `massUpdatePools`
```solidity
        if (_withUpdate) {
            massUpdatePools();
        }
```

If `_withUpdate` is set to false, an update won't be triggered, the allocation points percentages will be updated and the already accumulated rewards will be distributed based on the new terms.

However, anyone can frontrun this transaction with a call to `massUpdatePools()`. This will make it as the owner has called `set()` with `_withUpdate = true` and reward will be distributed based on the old terms.

```solidity
    function massUpdatePools() public {
        uint256 length = poolInfo.length;
        for(uint256 pid = 0; pid < length;) {
            updatePool(pid);
            unchecked { ++pid; }
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Unexpected distribution of rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This should be carefully rethought. Adding a modifier to massUpdatePools can help, but it does not solve the problem completely because there are other ways to cause a pool update.
