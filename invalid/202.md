# the `SophonFarming.sol` contract assumes all tokens in the contract have 18 decimals

## Summary

the `SophonFarming.sol` contract assumes all tokens in the contract have 18 decimals but we have `add()` function in the contract to add new pools and new tokens to contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail

all of the point calculations in the `SophonFarming.sol` contract in functions like `_pendingPoints()`, `_deposit()`, `increaseBoost()`, and `withdraw()` assume all tokens have 18 decimal. all tokens in the `initialize()` function have 18 decimals but we have an `add()` function to add more pool. As I asked the sponsor they may add tokens that don't have 18 decimals like `USDC` and it makes all calculations wrong in the system and can lead to wrong reward distribution. 

## Impact

this issue can lead to unfair reward distribution and loss of points for some users.

## Code Snippet

for exmaple lets check `_pendingPoints()` function.

```solidity
function _pendingPoints(uint256 _pid, address _user) internal view returns (uint256) {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user];

        uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;

        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        if (getBlockNumber() > pool.lastRewardBlock && lpSupply != 0) {
            uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());

            uint256 pointReward =
                blockMultiplier *
                pointsPerBlock *
                pool.allocPoint /
                totalAllocPoint;

            accPointsPerShare = pointReward *
                1e18 /
                lpSupply +
                accPointsPerShare;
        }

        return user.amount *
            accPointsPerShare /
            1e36 +
            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;
    }

```

## Recommendation

consider checking `decimal()` dynamically to support tokens with different decimals than 18.
