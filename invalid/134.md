# weETH and wstETH pools share the same `allocPoint`.

## Summary
The weETH and wstETH pools use the same `allocPoint`, but their exchange rates are not 1:1. Consequently, depositing the same USD value into one pool results in fewer reward points than depositing into the other, which is unfair to users.

## Vulnerability Detail
Each pool computes rewards proportionally to its `allocPoint`, but both weETH and wstETH pools share the same `allocPoint` (see code below). However, these two tokens have different prices.

```solidity
//Snippet from updatePool()
uint256 pointReward =
    blockMultiplier *
    _pointsPerBlock *
    _allocPoint /
    totalAllocPoint;


pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward /
    lpSupply +
    pool.accPointsPerShare;
}
```

Based on the prices at the time of writing this report, weETH is worth $3,843, while wstETH is worth $4,306. As a result, for the same USD value, you can deposit more weETH tokens than wstETH tokens. Therefore, depositing into the wstETH pool yields fewer points per dollar for the user.

## Impact
Depending on the relative prices of weETH and wstETH, depositing in one pool will result in fewer reward points than intended.

## Tool used
Manual Review.

## Recommendation
Consider using different `allocPoint` for the weETH and wstETH pools, based on their relative prices.
