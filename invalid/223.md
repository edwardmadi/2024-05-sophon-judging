# `Withdraw` lacks proper checks ,resulting in unexpected state



## Summary

`withdraw` function doesnt check if Boost amount can be greater than deposit amount during withdrawal,resulting in system being in an unexpected state.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `withdrawal` function 

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _pid, uint256 _withdrawAmount) external {
        if (isWithdrawPeriodEnded()) {
            revert WithdrawNotAllowed();
        }
        if (_withdrawAmount == 0) {
            revert WithdrawIsZero();
        }

        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][msg.sender];
        updatePool(_pid);

        uint256 userDepositAmount = user.depositAmount;

        if (_withdrawAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            _withdrawAmount = userDepositAmount;
        } else if (_withdrawAmount > userDepositAmount) {
            revert WithdrawTooHigh(userDepositAmount);
        }

        uint256 userAmount = user.amount;
        user.rewardSettled =
            userAmount *
            pool.accPointsPerShare /
            1e18 +
            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;

        user.depositAmount = userDepositAmount - _withdrawAmount;
        pool.depositAmount = pool.depositAmount - _withdrawAmount;

        userAmount = userAmount - _withdrawAmount;

        user.amount = userAmount;
        pool.amount = pool.amount - _withdrawAmount;

        pool.lpToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _withdrawAmount);

        user.rewardDebt = userAmount *
            pool.accPointsPerShare /
            1e18;

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _pid, _withdrawAmount);
    }
```

There are no explicit checks mentioned here checking whether boostAmount can be greater than depositAmount.The vulnerability lies in the fact the `deposit` ensures a check whether boostAmount can never be greater than deposit amount. 

```solidity

  function _deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _depositAmount, uint256 _boostAmount) internal {
        if (isFarmingEnded()) {
            revert FarmingIsEnded();
        }
        if (_depositAmount == 0) {
            revert InvalidDeposit();
        }
        if (_boostAmount > _depositAmount) {
            revert BoostTooHigh(_depositAmount);
        }

```
However such a check is absent in the `withdraw` function which can cause an invariant break.


## Impact

would drive system to a state where the boostamount would be greater than deposit amount causing users fund loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

ensure proper checks in the `withdraw` to ensure deposit should be always greater than boostAmount
