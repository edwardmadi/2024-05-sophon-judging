# Lack of Upper Limit for `BoosterMultiplier`

## Summary
The `SophonFarming` contract has a vulnerability where the `boosterMultiplier` lacks an upper limit. This can potentially allow the owner to set the booster multiplier to an excessively high value, leading to severe financial imbalances and exploitation risks within the farming system.
## Vulnerability Detail

The `setBoosterMultiplier` function in the `SophonFarming` contract allows the `owner` to set the booster multiplier, which impacts the boosting of farming rewards. Currently, there is no `upper limit` for this multiplier, which means the `owner` can set it to an arbitrarily high value. If the booster multiplier is set too high, it can disproportionately increase the rewards for certain users, disrupting the intended reward distribution mechanism and potentially draining the farming pool.
## Impact

Users could experience unexpected and extreme boosts, potentially disrupting the intended functionality of the farming protocol.
This could lead to economic inefficiencies, loss of user funds, and affect the stability of the farming ecosystem.
