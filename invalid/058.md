# Exchanging ETH for `stETH` during deposit is made at a loss due to missing slippage checks

## Summary
The lack of slippage control for `submit(...)` function can lead to a loss of assets (yield) and points for the affected users.


## Vulnerability Detail
User call `SophonFarming::depositWeth(...)` with the `_predefinedPool` set as `PredefinedPool.wstETH` to make deposit into a LIDO `stETH/ETH` pool in exchange for the `stETH` tokens by calling `_ethTOstEth(...)` which makes an external call the LIDO `submit(...)` which then cached the `stETH` amount returned in the `_finalAmount` variable. 

```solidity
File: SophonFarming.sol
808:     function _ethTOstEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
809:         // submit function does not return exact amount of stETH so we need to check balances
810:         uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this));
811:   @>    IstETH(stETH).submit{value: _amount}(address(this));
812:         return (IERC20(stETH).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore);
813:     }

```
However, it is a known fact that the LIDO `stETH/ETH` pool does not exchange ETH for stETH at a 1:1 ratio and historical data has shown that the pool has deppeged by up to 1.4% as shown in this [Chainlink price history data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PZKBAV7rhxJBa4xKwnobTt8KpauLOK31RLnHTGB4JO8/edit?usp=sharing). As you can see stETH has had periods of wild fluctuations the highest in 2023 reaching a Depeg of over 1.3%
Having said that, the amount of `stETH` tokens recieved will vary (smaller than expected)

In a nutshell, the `submit(...)` function lacks the slippage control that allows the users to revert if the minimum amount amount of `stETH` they received is less than the amount they expected to deposit and earn points for.

- Alice deposits 100wETH (indicating `_boostAmount` = 0 with the intent of increaseing boost after deposit) but the `submit(...)`  function returns 98.9stETH as her investment.
- she later calls `increaseBoost(...)` with the max amount of boost she can get, she will loose a yield and points worth 1.1ETH cummulative. 
- 100wETH of deposit will not give 100stETH worth of returns to Alice

## Impact
Users deposit into the LIDO stETH/ETH pool without slippage checks leading to loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Check the pool and see if it's cheaper to buy stETH from it
- Or add a slippage check to the `_ethTOstEth(...)` function
- Or refactor the code to only use stETH which avoids single sided exposure which creates further issues in the protocol
