# USDT can't be bridged out

## Summary
The protocol is not compatible with some tokens that don't return a boolean on approval, like USDT.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [bridgePool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L748) approves the token of the specified pool via `approve()`:
```solidity
...SNIP...
IERC20 lpToken = pool.lpToken;
lpToken.approve(address(bridge), depositAmount);
...SNIP...
```

This will revert if `lpToken` doesn't return a boolean because the interface expects a boolean to be returned. 

Tokens that return `false` on approvals failure are also not managed correctly because the return value is ignored, but this would lead to the transaction failing anyway when the token transfer is attempted so it's not an issue. 

## Impact
This will prevent the admins from bridging the staked tokens after the withdrawal period is ended, leading to the tokens being stuck in the contract.

## Recommendation
Use `safeApprove()` instead of `approve()`.
