# Missing Slippage Check

## Summary
 The `stETH` token is the liquid representation of the ETH staked in lido protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are places in the codebase that indicate that the implementation is assuming a peg of 1 ETH ~= 1 stETH. Even though both tokens have a tendency to keep the peg, this hasn't been always the case as it can be seen in  [this dashboard](https://dune.com/LidoAnalytical/Curve-ETHstETH). There have been many episodes of market volatility that affected the price of stETH, notably the one in last June when stETH traded at ~0.93 ETH.

## Impact
Assuming a fixed peg between `ETH` and `stETH` without accounting for potential deviations can lead to significant financial risks for users. If the `stETH` price drops well below 1 `ETH`, users depositing `ETH` based on the 1: ~1 peg assumption would incur losses, it could also be vulnerable to sandwich attack.
