# users who make deposit into a pool with zero/empty `pool.amount` (`lpSupply`) will loose their asset and not earn points

## Summary
Whenever a user makes a deposit into a empty pool, their asset is completely lost because their `UserInfo` is not recorded also the pool's `PoolInfo` are not updated before the `_deposit(...)` call ends.

The problem arises due to the improper implementation of the `updatePool(...)` function which I correct in the Recommendation section of this report.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user deposits any asset, an internal call is made to `_deposit(...)` function to update the state variables for the pool and the users details in the pool.

The `_deposit(...)` function **_compulsorily_** calls `updatePool(...)` function to settle the pool's accounting before the new deposit is recorded. However, the update function returns and ends execution when the pool's `lpSupply` is zero as shown below on L421

Hence the user made a deposit but has no record for points or lp in storage of the `SophonFarming` contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the deposit function as shown below

```solidity
    function _deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _depositAmount, uint256 _boostAmount) internal {
        if (isFarmingEnded()) {
            revert FarmingIsEnded();
        }
        if (_depositAmount == 0) {
            revert InvalidDeposit();
        }
        if (_boostAmount > _depositAmount) {
            revert BoostTooHigh(_depositAmount);
        }


        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][msg.sender];
 +      if (pool.amount > 0) {
 +           updatePool(_pid);
 +     }

```
