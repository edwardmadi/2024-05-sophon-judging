# `massUpdatePools` Should Always Be True After Farming Has Started in `add` Function

## Summary
In the `add` function, the `massUpdatePools` should always be called to true after farming has started to ensure that all pools are updated with the correct reward calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail
If `massUpdatePools` is not always true after farming has started, there could be inconsistencies in reward calculations across different pools. This might lead to some pools having outdated reward distributions, affecting the fairness and accuracy of the rewards.

## Impact
Failing to ensure that `massUpdatePools` is called after farming starts can lead to inaccurate reward calculations, potentially disadvantaging some users and causing trust issues within the farming mechanism.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `add` function to ensure that `massUpdatePools` is always called if farming has started, regardless of the `_withUpdate` parameter.

```solidity
function add(
    uint256 _allocPoint,
    IERC20 _lpToken,
    bool _withUpdate
) public onlyOwner {
    // Ensure massUpdatePools is called if farming has started
    if (getBlockNumber() > startBlock || _withUpdate) {
        massUpdatePools();
    }
    uint256 lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
    totalAllocPoint += _allocPoint;
    poolInfo.push(
        PoolInfo({
            lpToken: _lpToken,
            allocPoint: _allocPoint,
            lastRewardBlock: lastRewardBlock,
            accPointsPerShare: 0,
            amount: 0
        })
    );
}
```

### Explanation
1. Check if the current block number is greater than the start block of farming.
2. If farming has started, or if `_withUpdate` is true, call `massUpdatePools`.
3. Proceed with adding the new pool as before, ensuring reward calculations are updated for all pools consistently.
