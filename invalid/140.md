# Restricted Balance Handling in `SophonFarming.sol:withdrawProceeds` Function.

## Summary
The `withdrawProceeds` function in the contract allows the owner to withdraw proceeds stored in the `heldProceeds` mapping.
If `heldProceeds[_pid]` holds a value just one `wei` less than the actual balance, the withdrawal will fail.


## Vulnerability Detail
* The withdrawal amount entirely relies on the value stored in `heldProceeds[_pid]`. This variable determines how much the owner can withdraw. The issue arises because the withdrawal amount is entirely dependent on the value stored in `heldProceeds[_pid]`. If the actual balance of the contract is less than the amount stored in `heldProceeds[_pid]` (even by a single wei), the transaction will revert. This is due to the safeTransfer function, which fails if the contractâ€™s balance is insufficient. 


## Impact
Significant funds may be locked in the contract, becoming inaccessible to the owner. This situation can cause operational issues and financial losses, as the owner may be unable to withdraw proceeds.

## Recommendation
