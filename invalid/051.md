# Loss of funds to users near the end of withdrawal block due to many real life scenarios

## Summary
The user will not be able to withdraw their tokens after deposit if there withdraw is delayed due to certain real life scenarios .

## Vulnerability Detail
The user might have deposited 100 million tokens inside the farming contract's to accrue big points for airdrop rewards.

However , if the withdrawal block limit is very narrow like in tests , it is `1000`

```solidity

        sophonFarming.setEndBlock(maxUint - 1000, 1000);

```
given ethereum has block time of 12 seconds , if the withdrawal is only allowed for 1000 blocks 

that means every user who has staked their tokens has to withdraw in the time period of 12000 seconds = 200 minutes = 3.2 hours

which is quite unrealistic for everyone to withdraw in this period because people might have other priorities 

Now even if the withdrawal time range is big , 

The user's might not have initiated their withdrawal transaction due to reasons like 


- User might not recognize withdrawl is enabled 
   
- User might be away from their laptop due to real life's not-perfect scenarios like health problems , internet problems , 
  business or family matters to solve

- Transaction getting delayed due to network congestion or low gas fees etc when they initiate the TX just around the corner of ending withdrawal block

and other real life scenarios .

The tragedy is the contract is designed in a way that causes following issues 

- After farming has been ended , no one can extend the withdrawal period blocks
- There is no other emergency method to allow users to pull their funds when farming has been ended and withdrawal period has passed
- There is no other method where LPs are being transferred to users 

Now this situation might sound un-realistic but it in fact is the most realistic scenario we can have in real world.

When users are not allowed to withdraw their funds , this will simply lead to loss of their funds and funds will get stuck forever in the contract .

because withdraw was the only method to pull out funds from.

### PoC

Here is my PoC that demonstrates the issue 

Insert in `test/SophonFarming.t.sol`

```solidity
 function test_WithdrawDisabled() public {

        // We are changing critical params so they don't overflow and we can focus on main things

        vm.startPrank(deployer);
        sophonFarming.setEndBlock(1000000, 1000);
        harnessImplementation.setEndBlock(1000000, 1000);
        sophonFarming.setPointsPerBlock(pointsPerBlock);
        
        // A helping role to formalize update pool calls
        address keeper = vm.addr(76);

        // get config

        uint _startBlock = sophonFarming.startBlock();
        uint _endBlock = sophonFarming.endBlock();
        uint withdrwalBlockEnd=_endBlock + 1000;
        console.log("start block is ", _startBlock);
        console.log("end block is ", _endBlock);
        console.log("withdrwalBlockEnd is ", withdrwalBlockEnd);
        


        // ########## Step1. User deposit
        // #######################
        vm.roll(_startBlock + 10);
        // we are targetting wstETH pool for Account 1
        uint256 amountToDeposit1 = 100e18;
        uint256 poolId1 = sophonFarming.typeToId(
            SophonFarmingState.PredefinedPool.wstETH
        );

        vm.startPrank(account1);
        deal(address(wstETH), account1, amountToDeposit1);
        wstETH.approve(address(sophonFarming), amountToDeposit1);
        sophonFarming.deposit(poolId1, amountToDeposit1, 0);

        // Step 2. User has waited for some time to accrque rewards 
        // roll block to 10 more blocks to get some points unlocked
        vm.roll(block.number + 10);
        // fetch pool details to calculate how many rewards user will get when they do a withdraw in the next block
        // for simplicity , say the current block.number is 10 to ease calculations


        /*
        
         Step 3. User initiates withdraw TX is executed after one block
         
         User's TX being executed after the withdrwal period can happen due Multiple reasons

         - User might not recognize withdrawl is enabled 
         - User might be away from their laptop due to real life's not-perfect scenarios like health problems , internet problems , 
           business or family matters to solve
        - Transaction getting delayed due to network congestion or low gas fees etc when they initiate the TX just around the corner of ending
          withdrawal block

        */ 
       
        vm.roll(withdrwalBlockEnd+1); 
        sophonFarming.withdraw(poolId1,amountToDeposit1);  

    }
```

## Impact
Users will lose millions of dollars in tokens and funds will get stuck forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add another method to withdraw user funds by maybe deducting a small portion of their deposit amount like 1% but not entirely.

This will allow the flexible nature of protocol.
