# bridged funds will be stuck without a way to withdraw.

## Summary
Users can call `bridgePool(...)` to deposit funds to an L2 contract. Although the `_l2TxGasLimit` is specified, but the `_l2TxGasPerPubdataByte` is hardcoded to 0 and as such the bridged funds will get stuck without a way to withdraw. This means that gas is not sent with the transaction to the L2 for the execution of the deposit on the L2 and as such the deposit may get stuck in the L2 bridge contract.


```solidity
File: SophonFarming.sol
748:     function bridgePool(uint256 _pid) external {
...
764:         // TODO: change _refundRecipient, verify l2Farm, _l2TxGasLimit and _l2TxGasPerPubdataByte
765:         // These are pending the launch of Sophon testnet
766:         bridge.deposit(
767:             pool.l2Farm,            // _l2Receiver
768:             address(lpToken),       // _l1Token
769:             depositAmount,          // _amount
770             200000,                 // _l2TxGasLimit
771:   @>        0,                      // _l2TxGasPerPubdataByte
772:             owner()                 // _refundRecipient
773:         );

```
