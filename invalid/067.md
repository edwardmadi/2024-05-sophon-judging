# ETH deposits into SophonFarming via etherfi `weETH` pools are made at a loss to the user

## Summary
The lack of slippage control for `IweETH(weETH).wrap` function can lead to a substantial loss of assets (yield) and points for the affected users.

## Vulnerability Detail
User call `SophonFarming::depositEth(...)` with the `_predefinedPool` set as `PredefinedPool.weETH` to make deposit into a ether.fi `weETH/ETH` pool in exchange for the `weETH` tokens by calling `_eethTOweEth(...)` which makes an external call to ether.fi liquidity pool `deposit(...)` function which then cached the `eETH` amount received in the `_finalAmount `variable and it goes further to convert the eETH to weETH by calling the `IweETH(weETH).wrap(_amount)` to get `weETh.


```solidity
File: SophonFarming.sol
511:         if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.weETH) {
512:             _finalAmount = _ethTOeEth(_finalAmount);
513:         }
...

832:     function _ethTOeEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
833:         // deposit returns exact amount of eETH
834:         return IeETHLiquidityPool(eETHLiquidityPool).deposit{value: _amount}(address(this));
835:     }

...
843:     function _eethTOweEth(uint256 _amount) internal returns (uint256) {
844:         // wrap returns exact amount of weETH
845:         // @audit this is happening at a loss
846:         return IweETH(weETH).wrap(_amount);
847:     }

```

The movement of funds is in the order and ratio shown below
```solidity
-- ETH -> eETH       ............................ ~1:1.01
-- eETH-> weETH      ............................ ~ 1:0.9496

```

However,  the ether.fi `weETH/eETH` pool does not exchange eETH for weETH at a 1:1 ratio and at the time of writing this report 23/05/2024 
the price of eETH = $3860 while 
price of weETH = $4064
1$ = 1 / 4064 weETH
1$ = 1 / 3860 eETH
1 eETH = 3860 / 4064 wETH
1 eETH = 0.9498 wETH

In fact as of 21/05/2024 when the SEC released [this](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-sec-asks-exchanges-fine-tune-ether-etf-filings-positive-sign-approval-say-2024-05-21/) news, the eETh/weETh exchange rate was 1:0.8876

As you can see weETH/eETH has periods of wild fluctuations and Depeg of over 5.5%
Having said that, the amount of weETH tokens received will vary (smaller than expected)

In a nutshell, the `IweETH(weETH).wrap(...)` function lacks the slippage control that allows the users to revert if the minimum amount amount of `weETH` they received is less than the amount they expected to deposit and earn points for.

- Alice deposits 100wETH (indicating `_boostAmount` = 0 with the intent of increasing boost after deposit) but the `IweETH(weETH).wrap(...)` function returns 95eETH (considering profit from ETH -> eETH) as her investment.
- she later calls increaseBoost(...) with the max amount of boost she can get, she will loose  yield and points worth about 5wETH cummulative because the 
- 100wETH of deposit will not give 100weETH worth of returns to Alice

## Impact
Users deposit into the ether.fi weETH/ETH pool without slippage checks leading to loss of funds

Likelyhood = High
Impact = High

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add a slippage check to ensure the slippage is controlled

- Or refactor the code to only use weETH which avoids single sided exposure which creates further issues in the protocol
