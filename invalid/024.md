# A malicious user can get points risk-free using a sandwich attack

## Summary
A malicious user can get points risk-free using a sandwich attack
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can lock up their tokens in order to get points that will be later used for claiming an airdrop.
Imagine the following scenario:
1. User deposits 1000 tokens as the last transaction of a block
2. Let's say `accPointsPerShare` is equal to 1, then the following calculations will occur (we will ignore the multiplications and divisions used for precision for simplicity purposes):
```java
rewardSettled = userAmount * accPointsPerShare  + rewardSettled - rewardDebt
rewardSettled = 0 * 1 + 0 - 0
rewardSettled = 0

rewardDebt = userAmount * accPointsPerShare
rewardDebt = 1000 * 1
rewardDebt = 1000
```

3. User submits another deposit transaction for 1000 tokens as the first transaction of the next block, the following calculations will occur (as this is the next block, accPointsPerShare has increased, let's say it is 2 now):
```java
rewardSettled = userAmount * accPointsPerShare  + rewardSettled - rewardDebt
rewardSettled = 1000 * 2 + 0 - 1000
rewardSettled = 1000

rewardDebt = userAmount * accPointsPerShare
rewardDebt = 2000 * 2
rewardDebt = 4000
```

4. Then, user immediately withdraws his 2000 tokens, the following calculations will occur:
 
```java
rewardSettled = userAmount * accPointsPerShare + rewardSettled - rewardDebt
rewardSettled = 2000 * 2 + 1000 - 4000
rewardSettled = 1000

rewardDebt = userAmount * accPointsPerShare
rewardDebt = 0 * 2
rewardDebt = 0
```

5. Now, as mentioned by the protocol team, the amount of points a user has can be seen by calling `_pendingPoints()` where what the function returns is the following:
```java
amount * accPointsPerShare + rewardSettled - rewardDebt
0 * 2 + 1000 - 0 = 1000
```

The user has successfully generated himself 1000 points for essentially no risk, he can do this over and over again.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
An option would be to not allow a user to withdraw in the same block he deposited in.
