# Rewards are not distributed correctly, causing users to lose rewards

## Summary
Rewards are calculated based off the number of blocks users have deposited for. The problem is that the `lastRewardBlock` is updated globally for all users rather than for individual users, causing rewards to be distributed incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's assume Bob and Alice each have deposited `5e18 wstETH` into the `wstETH` pool.

Assume the following values:

`pool.allocPoint = 1000`
`totalAllocPoint = 10000`
`wstETH pool.amount = 10e18 (5e18 each)`
`pointsPerBlock = 2e18`
`pool.accPointsPerShare = 2e18`
`user.rewardSettled == user.rewardDebt`

Assume `10 blocks` have passed since both users have deposited their tokens. Bob decides to withdraw his `5e18 wstETH`.

[SophonFarming.sol#L699-L742](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L699-L742)
```javascript
    function withdraw(uint256 _pid, uint256 _withdrawAmount) external {
        if (isWithdrawPeriodEnded()) {
            revert WithdrawNotAllowed();
        }
        if (_withdrawAmount == 0) {
            revert WithdrawIsZero();
        }

        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][msg.sender];
@>      updatePool(_pid);

        uint256 userDepositAmount = user.depositAmount;

        if (_withdrawAmount == type(uint256).max) {
            _withdrawAmount = userDepositAmount;
        } else if (_withdrawAmount > userDepositAmount) {
            revert WithdrawTooHigh(userDepositAmount);
        }

        uint256 userAmount = user.amount;
        user.rewardSettled =
            userAmount *
            pool.accPointsPerShare /
            1e18 +
            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;

        user.depositAmount = userDepositAmount - _withdrawAmount;
        pool.depositAmount = pool.depositAmount - _withdrawAmount;

        userAmount = userAmount - _withdrawAmount;

        user.amount = userAmount;
        pool.amount = pool.amount - _withdrawAmount;

        pool.lpToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _withdrawAmount); 

        user.rewardDebt = userAmount *
            pool.accPointsPerShare /
            1e18;

        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _pid, _withdrawAmount);
    }
```

Firstly, the pool accounting is updated.

[SophonFarming.sol#L411-L435](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L411-L435)
```javascript
    function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        if (getBlockNumber() <= pool.lastRewardBlock) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        uint256 _pointsPerBlock = pointsPerBlock;
        uint256 _allocPoint = pool.allocPoint;
        if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
            pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
            return; 
        }
        uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());
        uint256 pointReward =
            blockMultiplier *
            _pointsPerBlock *
            _allocPoint /
            totalAllocPoint;

        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward / 
            lpSupply +
            pool.accPointsPerShare;

@>      pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber(); //@audit next withdrawer will suffer, since rewards points depend on this value
    }
```

Note that at the end of the function, `pool.lastRewardBlock` is set to the current `block.number`. Since rewards are distributed based off how many blocks users have deposited for, this will make the next user lose a majority of their rewards. The correct solution is to update the `lastRewardBlock` for individual users, rather than for all users at once.

Continuing with the example:

Recall that `10 blocks` have passed, therefore `blockMultiplier = 10e18`:

[SophonFarming.sol#L344-L346](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L344-L346)
```javascript
   if (_to > _from) {
            return (_to - _from) * 1e18; 
        }
```

We have `pointReward = 10e18 * 2e18 * 1000 / 10000 = 2000000000000000000000000000000000000`
=> `pool.accPointsPerShare = 2000000000000000000000000000000000000 / 10e18 + 2e18 = 2200000000000000000`

Now, back to withdraw function. 

`user.rewardSettled = userAmount * pool.accPointsPerShare / 1e18`
=> `user.rewardSettled = 5e18 * 2200000000000000000 / 1e18 = 11000000000000000000`

Bob's reward points are settled at `11e18`.

Assume 1 block has passed (total of `11 blocks` since Alice's first deposit), now Alice decides to withdraw her `5e18 wstETH`.

Again, a call to `updatePool()` first.

Since `pool.lastRewardBlock` was just updated 1 block ago during Bob's withdrawal, `blockMultiplier` is now `1e18`. This is incorrect, as Alice has deposited for 11 blocks, which should give a `blockMultiplier` value of `11e18`. 

The problem was that when Bob called withdraw, the `pool.lastRewardBlock` was updated to the `block.number` at that time, and the `blockMultiplier` is calculated based off how many blocks have passed since `pool.lastRewardBlock`. 

The changes to `lastRewardBlock` in that case should have only applied to Bob, not Alice. Now Alice only gets rewarded for depositing for `1 block`, rather than the full `11 blocks`, whereas Bob got rewarded for the full `10 blocks`.

Alice in this case suffers and loses rewards.

## Impact
Loss of rewards for users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommendation is to update the `lastRewardBlock` for individual users, for example:

```diff
    function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
+       UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][msg.sender];
-       if (getBlockNumber() <= pool.lastRewardBlock) {
+       if (getBlockNumber() <= user.lastRewardBlock) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        uint256 _pointsPerBlock = pointsPerBlock;
        uint256 _allocPoint = pool.allocPoint;
        if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
-           pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
+           user.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
            return; 
        }
-       uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());
+       uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(user.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());
        uint256 pointReward =
            blockMultiplier *
            _pointsPerBlock *
            _allocPoint /
            totalAllocPoint;

        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward / 
            lpSupply +
            pool.accPointsPerShare;

-       pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
+       user.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
    }
```

Of course, this is a change that would require reimplementation of many of the core functionalities. But this way, users will have the correct `lastRewardBlock` updated for their respective reward. Coming back to the example from above, after Bob's withdrawal, Alice's `lastRewardBlock` would correctly be 11 blocks ago and only Bob's `lastRewardBlock` would be 1 block ago.
