# New pool cannot be added to the farm if the `lpSupply` of at least one pool is zero

## Summary
In order to add a pool to the farm,  the `owner` calls `SophonFarming::add(...)`. If this call is made with the option (`_withUpdate` = `true`) to update the accounting for all pools, then the `massUpdatePools()` function is called to loop over and update accounting for all pools. 
```solidity
File: SophonFarming.sol
153:     function add(..., bool _withUpdate) public onlyOwner {
...
160:  @>     if (_withUpdate) {
161:  @>         massUpdatePools(); // @audit if the is called when the lpSupply of any pool is zero, it will return without updating the parameters

```
The [`massUpdatePools()` function loops](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L401) over ALL the pools and calls the `updatePool(...)` for each of the pools. However, the `updatePool(...)` function returns and ends execution if it encounters any empty pool without updating the allocation point for the pool of interest even if it's own `lpSupply` is greater than zero.
```solidity
File: SophonFarming.sol
411:     function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public {
412:         PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
413:         if (getBlockNumber() <= pool.lastRewardBlock) {
414:             return;
415:         }
416:         uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
417:         uint256 _pointsPerBlock = pointsPerBlock;
418:         uint256 _allocPoint = pool.allocPoint;
419:  @>     if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
420:             pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
421:  @>         return;
422:         }

```

## Vulnerability Detail

- Consider 3 pools lp1, lp2 and lp3 respectively with `lpSupply` 1000lp1, 0lp2, 1000lp3
- admin calls `add(...)` for lp4 to add a 4th pool
- as seen on `L419` above, the call to `add` will return and end  because the `lpSupply` of lp2 is zero.
- hence the lp4  is not added to the pools in the farm


## Impact
- This breaks core protocol functionality as the `lpSupply` of one pool affects adding another pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
Modify the `add(...)` function to update only the pool whose allocation point is being set as shown below:

```solidity
File: SophonFarming.sol
153:     function add(..., bool _withUpdate) public onlyOwner {
...
160:  -      if (_withUpdate) {
161:  -          massUpdatePools(); // @audit if the is called when the lpSupply of any pool is zero, it will return without updating the parameters

```
