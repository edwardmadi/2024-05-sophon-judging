# `massUpdatePools` and `updatePool` Can Cause DoS Due to Public Visibility

## Summary
The functions` massUpdatePools` and `updatePool` are publicly accessible, which can be exploited to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by continuously calling these functions and consuming gas.
## Vulnerability Detail
Both `massUpdatePools` and `updatePool` are publicly visible, allowing anyone to call these functions repeatedly. This could lead to excessive gas consumption and could potentially disrupt the normal operation of the contract by making it expensive to use.
## Impact
Continuous calling of `massUpdatePools` and `updatePool` can lead to increased gas costs, making it difficult for legitimate users to interact with the contract. This could result in a DoS attack, affecting the contract's usability and performance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the visibility of `massUpdatePools` and `updatePool` functions to `internal`. Only the necessary functions that should trigger these updates should have the authority to call them.
