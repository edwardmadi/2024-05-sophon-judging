# Yield from pools is not collected

## Summary
The `SophonFarming` contract doesn't collect any yield made by third party contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
The idea of the contract is to let users deposit their assets in it and earn rewards for that. When depositing, users may chose which pool to send their funds to and this pool starts generating yield. 

For example, a user may [depositDai](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L458-L466). The contract will pull the DAI from the user and deposit in to the sDAI vault. The vault will mint shares to the SophonFarming contract and these shares will be added to the user's balance.

However, the yield earned by sDAI is not collected by the SophonFarming contract. This means that the following is possible:
 - A user deposits 1000 DAI for the duration of the farming
 - The contract converts it to sDAI and holds it
 - When the farming ends, the user has accumulated reward points
 - The user withdraws their sDAI shares which have amounted to 1200 DAI

>[!NOTE]
>This example is with DAI, but the same is true for the others pools - for example wstETH

## Impact
The user received both additional DAI and reward points and the Sophon protocol received nothing.
