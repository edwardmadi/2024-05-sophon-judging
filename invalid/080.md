# Depositing different assets with different intrinsic value in dollars gives the same amount of points

## Summary
The ``SophonFarming.sol`` contract supports different assets for pools with different intrinsic dollar value. However there is no oracle used within the protocol. For example sDAI and wstETH assets are supported as lpTokens for pools, meaning that users can deposit this assets and get points back. As can be seen from the [updatePool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L411-L435) function, this is how **accPointsPerShare** are calculated for each pool. 

```solidity
    function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        if (getBlockNumber() <= pool.lastRewardBlock) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        uint256 _pointsPerBlock = pointsPerBlock;
        uint256 _allocPoint = pool.allocPoint;
        if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
            pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
            return;
        }
        uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());
        uint256 pointReward =
            blockMultiplier *
            _pointsPerBlock *
            _allocPoint /
            totalAllocPoint;

        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward /
            lpSupply +
            pool.accPointsPerShare;

        pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
    }
```

**blocMultiplier** and **_pointsPerBlock** are the same for all pools, **_allocPoint** is set separately for each pool and **totalAllocPoint** is the sum of all pools **allocPoint**. At the time of writing this report the price of **sDAI** is **1.08** and the price of **wstETH** is  **4,312.99** in dollars.  If we assume that **allocPoint** is equal for both pools and **lpSupply** is equal as well, then the users depositing into the **sDAI** pool will receive the same amount of points for depositing **$1.08** as the users depositing **$4,312.99** in the **wstETH** pool. The price of **wstETH** is very volatile and manually setting the **allocPoint** parameter for the **wstETH** pool won't work. The Sophon team haven't mentioned any keeper that will update the **allocPoint** parameter for every pool at the beginning of each block, even if they do those transactions can be frontrun by malicious users. 
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Discrepancy in the way **accPointsPerShare** are calculated for each pool, results in users receiving the same amount of points for very different dollar value.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either allow only one lpToken to be deposited by users, or implement an oracle and determine the **allocPoint** parameter based on price changes in each block, only in this way the deposited dollar amount of tokens will be close to equal for deposits in all pools across the protocol.
