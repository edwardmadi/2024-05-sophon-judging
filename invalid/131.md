# Bridging funds could be DOSed

## Summary
Bridging funds could be DOSed
## Vulnerability Detail
After the farming and withdrawing periods are over, any user can bridge the deposited funds using `bridgePool()`. Then, the `isBridged` mapping gets set to true for that particular pool. In case of any fail of the bridging, the owner can call this function:
```solidity
    function revertFailedBridge(uint256 _pid) external onlyOwner {
        isBridged[_pid] = false;
    }
```
Then, `bridgePool()` can be called again, this time hopefully successfully. However, there is a possible issue that will occur in case a token like USDT gets added as a pool token.

As confirmed with the sponsors, there will be other pool tokens added to the whitelist.
If USDT gets added to the whitelist, the following issue can occur:
1. `bridgePool()` gets called at the appropriate time
2. The function passes but the bridging is not successful so the owner calls `revertFailedBridge()`
3. The function gets called again but this time it will revert and will be DOSed forever due to the following line:
```solidity
lpToken.approve(address(bridge), depositAmount);
```
Since USDT was already approved during the first call of the function, the next time it gets called it will revert as USDT does not allow non-zero to non-zero approvals. This will cause the function to be DOSed permanently and cause the funds to be locked.
