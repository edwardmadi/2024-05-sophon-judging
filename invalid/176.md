# reward point calculation mechanism logic issue

## Summary
The vulnerability originates from the interaction between the `deposit` function : 
```solidity
    function deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount, uint256 _boostAmount) external {
        poolInfo[_pid].lpToken.safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            _amount
        );

        _deposit(_pid, _amount, _boostAmount);
    }

```
 and the `_getBlockMultiplier` function :
 ```solidity
     function _getBlockMultiplier(uint256 _from, uint256 _to) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _endBlock = endBlock;
        if (_endBlock != 0) {
            _to = Math.min(_to, _endBlock);
        }
        if (_to > _from) {   //@audit this will never be true
            return (_to - _from) * 1e18;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
 ```
  within the contract. The deposit function currently lacks a check to verify if the farming period has begun before accepting deposits.

Additionally anyone can call `updatePool` function and update `lastRewardBlock` variable as we can see here :
```solidity
    function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public { //@audit this seems problematic
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        if (getBlockNumber() <= pool.lastRewardBlock) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        uint256 _pointsPerBlock = pointsPerBlock;
        uint256 _allocPoint = pool.allocPoint;
        if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
            pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
            return;
        }
        uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());
        uint256 pointReward =
            blockMultiplier *
            _pointsPerBlock *
            _allocPoint /
            totalAllocPoint;

        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward /
            lpSupply +
            pool.accPointsPerShare;

        pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
    }
```
  
## Vulnerability Detail

### Imagine the following scenario:
* `Farming` period starts at block 1000.
* `_endBlock` is set to block 2500 (farming period ends at block 2500).
* User A deposits at block 1500.
* User B deposits at block 2000.
* User B calls the updatePool function.

By updating `lastRewardBlock`, the block multiplier calculation effectively resets. The calculation now considers the block range from `lastRewardBlock` to `_endBlock`

* User A, who deposited earlier and accumulated points based on the initial block range is disadvantaged.
* Their points are calculated using a potentially lower effective block range compared to the manipulated calculation for User B

## Impact
### Unfair Advantage for Late Deposits
While there isn't a check for the farming period ending, the current logic using `_getBlockMultiplier` might still give a slight advantage to users who deposit later within the valid period. This is because the multiplier considers the block range since the last reward distribution, potentially benefiting later depositors who have a larger effective block range for their points calculation compared to earlier participants.
### Malicious Manipulation
The `updatePool` function updates the `lastRewardBlock` variable, which is used to calculate the block multiplier for reward distribution. The concern is that anyone can call this function, potentially manipulating the lastRewardBlock value and influencing the multiplier calculation.
