# Insufficient Storage Gap Provision for Upgradable Contract SophonFarming

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L21

The SophonFarming contract is designed to be upgradable but lacks a __gap storage variable. This omission can lead to storage layout issues in future upgrades, potentially causing data corruption and contract malfunctioning.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract does not include a __gap array to reserve space for future storage variables. Without this, adding new storage variables in future versions can shift the layout of existing variables, leading to unexpected behavior and potential data corruption.




## Impact
Future upgrades that introduce new storage variables may corrupt existing data.
Shifting storage layouts can cause the contract to malfunction, leading to loss of functionality or incorrect behavior.
Â Malfunctioning contracts can be exploited, leading to potential financial losses or unauthorized actions.

## Code Snippet
contract SophonFarming is Upgradeable2Step, SophonFarmingState {}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```sol
contract SophonFarming is Upgradeable2Step, SophonFarmingState {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;

    // Existing code...

    // Reserve space for future storage variables
    uint256[50] private __gap;
}
```
