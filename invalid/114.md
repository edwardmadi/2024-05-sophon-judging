# Proxy not following EIP1967

## Summary
proxy setup should be following EIP1964 for implementation and owner storage. /

## Vulnerability Detail
When using the proxy architecture it is recommended to use a predefined storage slot for implementation and admin according to EIP1967. This will the storage collisions impossible and make the integration easier for various third-party analytics systems like block scanners etc. 

But the `SophonFarmingProxy` is not following the EIP1967.

## Impact
I think due to the consistent storage variable across proxy and implementation, storage collision is not possible but external integration where protocol looks for the specific slots for implementation address will fail.
