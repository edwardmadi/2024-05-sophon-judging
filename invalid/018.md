# Allows user to deposit into `sDAI` PredefinedPool by calling `depositEth`/`depositWeth`, consuming `DAI` reserves from the contract if present.

## Summary
A user can call `depositEth` or `depositWeth` by passing `_predefinedPool` as `0` (i.e. `PredefinedPool.sDAI`) and consume the contract's DAI reserves, as the user never sent DAI to the contract. This would cause an issue when someone tries to call `withdraw` but is unable to withdraw since there is less DAI available than deposited.

## Vulnerability Detail
Both function `depositEth` and `depositWeth` have this particular conditions. If a user calls any of this functions by passing `_predefinedPool` as `0` (i.e. `PredefinedPool.sDAI`), it'll bypass these conversions and call `_depositPredefinedAsset` to deposit DAI into sDAI pool, with the same amount of ETH sent.

```javascript
        if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.wstETH) {
            _finalAmount = _ethTOstEth(_finalAmount);
        } else if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.weETH) {
            _finalAmount = _ethTOeEth(_finalAmount);
        }
```

## Impact
It may seem like a loss for the particular user and not the protocol (since let's say protocol got 1 ETH but only lost 1 DAI), the issue would arise when a genuine user tries to call `withdraw` but is unable to do so, due to lack of token reserves in the contract. This would also affect pointRewards whenever `updatePool` is called.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revert the transaction if any other value for PredefinedPool is passed.
```diff
        if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.wstETH) {
            _finalAmount = _ethTOstEth(_finalAmount);
        } else if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.weETH) {
            _finalAmount = _ethTOeEth(_finalAmount);
+       } else {
+           revert InvalidDeposit();
        }
```
