# First depositor can exponentially increase the ``accPointsPerShare`` value which leads to depositors getting large number of points for airdrop.

## Summary
First depositor can exponentially increase the ``accPointsPerShare`` value which leads to depositors getting large number of points for airdrop.

## Vulnerability Detail
``updatePool()`` function is used to update accounting of a single pool. It updates ``pool.accPointsPerShare`` value which in return is used to calculated pending points for a user in a pool. 
```solidity

  function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        if (getBlockNumber() <= pool.lastRewardBlock) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        uint256 _pointsPerBlock = pointsPerBlock;
        uint256 _allocPoint = pool.allocPoint;
        if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
            pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
            return;
        }
        uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());
        uint256 pointReward = blockMultiplier * _pointsPerBlock * _allocPoint / totalAllocPoint;

        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward / lpSupply + pool.accPointsPerShare;
        pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
    }
```
Here, ``pool.accPointsPerShare`` is calculated as:
```solidity
           pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward / lpSupply + pool.accPointsPerShare; // lpSupply = pool.amount
```
But, ``if(lpSupply == 0)``, the ``updatepool()`` function just returns:
```solidity
        if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
            pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
            return;
        }
```
Thus, when the first deposit occurs, ``pool.accPointsPerShare`` is not updated and the ``updatepool()`` function just returns. But, when the second deposit occurs, ``lpSupply`` uses value of first deposit amount as ``pool.amount`` is updated later after updating pool.
```solidity
    function _deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _depositAmount, uint256 _boostAmount) internal {
        if (isFarmingEnded()) {
            revert FarmingIsEnded();
        }
        if (_depositAmount == 0) {
            revert InvalidDeposit();
        }
        if (_boostAmount > _depositAmount) {
            revert BoostTooHigh(_depositAmount);
        }

        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][msg.sender];
        updatePool(_pid);
...
       pool.amount = pool.amount + _depositAmount + _boostAmount;
```
This leads to first depositor depositing minimum amount``(1 wei)`` to exponentially increase ``pool.accPointsPerShare`` in the ``updatePool()`` function.

## Impact
This leads to imbalance in points calculation and malicious users can manipulate new added pools to boost their points for better chance at an airdrop.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Deposit some amount into the pool by calling ``_deposit()`` function directly in the ``initialize()`` function for predefined pools and in the ``add()`` function for newly added pools.
