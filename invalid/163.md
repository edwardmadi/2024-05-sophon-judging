# `user.rewardSettled` after withdrawal and `_pendingPoints(...)` calculation breaks accounting for user 's pending points

## Summary

`user.rewardDebt` is the amount of point entitled to an _already distributed_ to a user and recorded.
`user.rewardSettled` on the other hand is the amount of reward entitled to a used and _pending distribution_.
However, the `_pendingPoints(...)` calculation breaks accounting for the protocol due to its discrepancy in the actual reward point earned at the point of withdrawal leading to a potential leak of value as described below

378:         }
379: 
380:         // We do some fancy math here. Basically, any point in time, the amount of points
381:         // entitled to a user but is pending to be distributed is:
382:         //   pending reward = (user.amount * pool.accPointsPerShare) - user.rewardDebt
383:         return user.amount * accPointsPerShare / 1e36 +  user.rewardSettled - user.rewardDebt;

## Vulnerability Detail
For simplicity, I'll use ETH as the deposit asset
Assume that:
`pool.amount` = 0
`pool.accPointsPerShare` = 100e18 points
`user.rewardDebt` = 0
- at t = 0s, user deposits 100ETH and his rewards as calculated 
    - `pool.amount` = 100ETH
    - on L597 `user.rewardSettled` = 10000e18 and 
    - on L621 `user.rewardDebt` = 10000e18 
    - undistributed rewards = 10000e18
- at t 1000s user withdraws 90ETH remaining 10ETh and his rewards as calculated
    - `pool.amount` = 10ETH
    - on L723 `user.rewardSettled` = 10000e18 and
    - on L737 `user.rewardDebt` = 1000e18 and
    - undistributed rewards = 9000e18
- `_pendingPoints(...)` is called for user
    - `pool.amount` has reduced to 10ETH, 
    - `pointReward` has not changed because `blockMultiplier`, `pointsPerBlock` `pool.allocPoint`, `totalAllocPoint` have not changed at this point
    - `accPointsPerShare` will increase ( `pointReward * 1e18 / 10e18 + 100e18`) as shown on L377 to say 120e18
- pending points is calculated as shown on L383
 ```solidity
user.amount * accPointsPerShare / 1e36 +  user.rewardSettled - user.rewardDebt;
// 10e18 * 120e18 * 1e18 / 1e36 + 10000e18
// = 11200e18
```
As shown below, the the discrepancy between the `user.rewardSettled` and the pending points returned by `_pendingPoints(...)`.

```solidity
11200e18 - 10000e18  = 1200e18
```

The user is seen here to have a pending 1200e18 rewards manufactured out of thin air

## Impact
This: 
- breaks core protocol functionality because of discrepancies
- possible leak of value in points distribution as user can earn more points than thy are entitled to

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

A trivial solution is not in sight at this time, however returning the `user.rewardSettled` could just be the solution here whenever `_pendingPoints(...)` is called and the `blockMultiplier`, `pointsPerBlock` `pool.allocPoint`, `totalAllocPoint` have not changed. Also worhty of note is that decreasing the pool's `lpSupply` actually increases the `accPointsPerShare`.
