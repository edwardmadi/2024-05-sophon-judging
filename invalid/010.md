# use `safeApprove` instead `approve`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Tokens not compliant with the ERC20 specification could return false from the `approve` function call to indicate the approval fails, while the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked.

## Recommendation
Use the safeApprove function instead, which reverts the transaction with a proper error message when the return value of approve is false.
