# Users are not protected against deposit slippage

## Summary
The are a lot of reasons why a transaction may stay for a long time in the mempool - low gas provided, network congestion, etc. Users make decision in which pool to deposit based on the `allocPoints` the given pool has. Since these points can change and there is no slippage parameter, users may lose their tokens for rewards that don't satisfy them.

## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine the following scenario:
  - Alice sees a certain pool gets 40% of all rewards so she deposits 10_000 USDC there and decides to boost them all.
  - The Sophon team has made a decision to decrease the % of the pool to 10% by calling [set()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L195-L216)
  - The Sophon's transaction is mined before Alice's transaction
  - Alice ends up depositing in a pool which is not profitable for her and since she boosted her whole deposit, it's impossible to withdraw.

>[!NOTE]
> The same is true for `pointsPerBlock` and `boostMultiplier`
  
## Impact
Medium since users lose their tokens forever, but still receive some rewards. 

> [!Warning]
> If the team plans to deactivate reward pools by setting their % to 0, the impact becomes high

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a slippage parameter to the `deposit` function and revert the transaction  `allocPoints`, `pointsPerBlock` or `boostMultiplier` are not a predefined expected value.
