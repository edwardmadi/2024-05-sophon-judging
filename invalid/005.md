# SophonFarming deposit functions contain no minimum checks for number of stETH or wstETH minted

## Summary

`SophonFarming` deposits `ETH` and `wETH` to LIDO and other similar protocols, however users are not able to specify the minimum amounts of tokens they wish to be credited to their rewards account in Sophon after the conversions. This can lead to users sustaining financial damage due to slashing on the protocol integrations.

## Vulnerability Detail
[SophonFarming.sol#L503-L539](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L503-L539)
```solidity
    function depositEth(uint256 _boostAmount, PredefinedPool _predefinedPool) public payable {
        if (msg.value == 0) {
            revert NoEthSent();
        }

        uint256 _finalAmount = msg.value;
        if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.wstETH) {
            _finalAmount = _ethTOstEth(_finalAmount);
        } else if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.weETH) {
            _finalAmount = _ethTOeEth(_finalAmount);
        }

        _depositPredefinedAsset(_finalAmount, msg.value, _boostAmount, _predefinedPool);
    }
...SKIP!...
    function depositWeth(uint256 _amount, uint256 _boostAmount, PredefinedPool _predefinedPool) external {
        IERC20(weth).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            _amount
        );

        uint256 _finalAmount = _wethTOEth(_amount);
        if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.wstETH) {
            _finalAmount = _ethTOstEth(_finalAmount);
        } else if (_predefinedPool == PredefinedPool.weETH) {
            _finalAmount = _ethTOeEth(_finalAmount);
        }

        _depositPredefinedAsset(_finalAmount, _amount, _boostAmount, _predefinedPool);
    }
```
When users deposit `ETH` or `WETH` their deposit will be converted to different LST depending on their input. Users are unable to pass any minimum amonts of tokens they want minted during the conversion, which can cause users to receive less than ideal shares.

The price of `stETH` or `wstETH` is not constant and not always increasing compared to ETH:

> Slashing risk
>
> ETH validators risk staking penalties, with up to 100% of staked funds at risk if validators fail. To minimise this risk, 
> Lido Protocol stakes across multiple professional and reputable node operators with heterogeneous setups, with 
> additional mitigation in the form of insurance that is paid from Lido Protocol fees.

## Impact

If users deposit into SophonFinance expecting a certain number of `stETH` and `wstETH` to be minted, which is then credited to the user's account balance in `_deposit` and used for future rewards, they may receive less due to slashing or other market forces.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow users to pass in a minimum amount that should be credited towards their account balance after all conversions are completed. This ensures that any minting price changes during the transaction being mined do not cause the user to experience any losses beyond what they find acceptable.
