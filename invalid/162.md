# SophonFarming.sol::_pendingPoints() - Doesn't check `pool.allocPoint != 0`, which can lead to a DoS

## Summary
`_pendingPoints` returns all the pending points that the user has accumulated + all the points he has accumulated up to this point.

```solidity
function _pendingPoints(uint256 _pid, address _user) internal view returns (uint256) {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user];

        uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;

        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        if (getBlockNumber() > pool.lastRewardBlock && lpSupply != 0) {
            uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());

            uint256 pointReward =
                blockMultiplier *
                pointsPerBlock *
                pool.allocPoint /
                totalAllocPoint;

            accPointsPerShare = pointReward *
                1e18 /
                lpSupply +
                accPointsPerShare;
        }

        return user.amount *
            accPointsPerShare /
            1e36 +
            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;
    }
```

We'll focus on the if statement, we check if `getBlockNumber() > pool.lastRewardBlock` and `lpSupply != 0`. 

The checks somewhat mimic the ones done in `updatePool`:
```solidity
function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        if (getBlockNumber() <= pool.lastRewardBlock) {
            return;
        }
        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        uint256 _pointsPerBlock = pointsPerBlock;
        uint256 _allocPoint = pool.allocPoint;
        if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
            pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
            return;
        }
...
```
The second iff also checks `_pintsPerBlock == 0` and `_allocPoint == 0`.

These two checks are missing in `_pendingRewards`, at first glance this isn't an issue, because if `_pointsPerBlock = 0` then `pointReward = 0`, which is fine.
## Vulnerability Detail
If `pool.allocPoint = 0` then it's also fine, as `_pointsPerBlock = 0` again.

But it's possible that `totalAllocPoint = 0` as well, which is a problem, as that will be a division by 0, which will panic revert and DoS the function.
If all `pool.allocPoint = 0` then `totalAllocPoint` will also be 0.

If this happens after `isFarmingEnded = true`, then set can't be called which will permanently DoS the function for any pool.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `point.allocPoint != 0` to the if statement, so it mimics the check inside `updatePool`
