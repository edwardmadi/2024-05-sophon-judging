# The formula for calculating pending points was unnecessarily multiplied by 1e18


## Summary
The formula for calculating pending points was unnecessarily multiplied by 1e18 
## Vulnerability Detail
It was  multiplied by 1e18 in _getBlockMultiplier.
```javascript
 function _getBlockMultiplier(uint256 _from, uint256 _to) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _endBlock = endBlock;
        if (_endBlock != 0) {
            _to = Math.min(_to, _endBlock);
        }
        if (_to > _from) {
@>            return (_to - _from) * 1e18;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
```
howerve It was  multiplied by 1e18 two more times in `_pendingPoints` function Only divided by 1e36.
Therefore, the result was erroneously increased by a factor of 1e18.
```javascript
function _pendingPoints(uint256 _pid, address _user) internal view returns (uint256) {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user];

@>        uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;

        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        if (getBlockNumber() > pool.lastRewardBlock && lpSupply != 0) {
@>            uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());

            uint256 pointReward =
                blockMultiplier *
                pointsPerBlock *
                pool.allocPoint /
                totalAllocPoint;
            accPointsPerShare = pointReward *
@>                1e18 /
                lpSupply +
                accPointsPerShare;
        }

        return user.amount *
            accPointsPerShare /
            1e36 +
@>            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;
    }
```
## Impact
Making the user believe they can obtain more points than they should.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
- uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;
+ uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare ;
```
