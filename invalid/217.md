# No slippage protection on convert functions in `SophonFarming`.

## Summary
User can be front-runned on the `deposit` procedure and due to the conversion of `token` to `lpToken` lose instantly lot of value leading to less points and loss of funds for him.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can deposit their funds in the `SophonFarming` contract calling the relevant `depositXXX` funcion and convert their funds to the `lpToken` before the deposital. However, in this procedure there is no slippage protection that will guarantee that the user will got entitled to the same amount of `lpToken` as the amount of funds that he deposited and, also, the points that he deserved. For example, let's take the scenario that user calls `depositStEth()` function and wants to deposit 1 `stETH`. Then the `_depositPredefinedAsset()` function will be called that will try to convert the 1 `stETH` to a `wstETH` amount calling `_stEthTOwstEth()` `wraping` the `stETH`. However, nowhere the `finalAmount` returned is compared to be at least close to the `initalAmount` in `seETH`. That means that a malicious front-runner could perfom an attack on the `WstETH` part and make the `finalAmount` a lot less than expected by `wrapping` his big amount(maybe flash loaned) and then back running the user's transaction. This is totally possible, since the `wrap` function lies on the pooled ETH as we can see in the [line 1076 of WstETH contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7f39c581f595b53c5cb19bd0b3f8da6c935e2ca0#code). This attack can happen on other `depositXXX` functions that convert the `token` to `lpToken` too but for simplicity we analyzed only this. 

## Impact
MEV Front-running attacks can be performed on the convert functions and diminish instantly the deposited amount of user and also the reward points that he is entitled to.

## Tool used
Manual code inspection

## Recommendation
Consider adding a slippage protection mechanism in convert functions in which the user will select the minimum amount of `lpToken` that he will accept of the conversion.
