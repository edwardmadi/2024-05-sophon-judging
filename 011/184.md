# Precision Loss in Calculating `finalBoostAmount` in  `increaseBoost()` function

## Summary
`finalBoostAmount` is suspectible to precision loss leading to less increase in boost than desired
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can call `IncreaseBoost()` function to increase their boost from their existing deposits. Function calculates `finalBoostAmount` by applying the `multiplier` to the boost amount.
 The calculation of `finalBoostAmount` involves multiplication and division which can lead to precision loss:

[SophonFarming.sol#L665](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/05059e53755f24ae9e3a3bb2996de15df0289a6c/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L665)
```js
uint256 finalBoostAmount = _boostAmount * boosterMultiplier / 1e18;
```
If `_boostAmount * boosterMultiplier` results in a fractional number, the division by `1e18` might result in a truncation.

Simple Example:

If `_boostAmount` is 100 and `boosterMultiplier` is 1.5 * 1e18, `finalBoostAmount` will be 100 * 1.5 = 150.
If `_boostAmount` is 101 and `boosterMultiplier` is 1.5 * 1e18, `finalBoostAmount` will be 101 * 1.5 = 151.5, which gets truncated to 151, losing 0.5.
It's a simple example demonstrating precision loss which can be higher depending upon the `_boostAmount` and `boosterMultiplier` values.

## Impact
User boost will increase by a less amount leading to less points

## Recommendation
Use fixed-point arithmetic or higher precision data types to handle multiplication and division operations involving boosterMultiplier and _boostAmount.
