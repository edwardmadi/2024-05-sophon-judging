# Reentrancy in SophonFarming::bridgepool

## Summary
Reentrancy in SophonFarming::bridgepool

## Vulnerability Detail
There could be a possible reentrancy attack in SophonFarming::bridgepool() function.

In order to attack this function:

1. the bridgepool() function is called .
2. lptoken approves the bridge to use the funds.
3. the bridge calls the external `deposit()` function which could be attacked causing the deposit of unwanted lptokens in the farm leading to excessive amounts of funds flowing in the contract.

## Impact
The flow of excessive funds could lead to wrong calculation of userInfo rewards calcualtion. Due to increase in the tokens `lpsupply` increases which in turn leads to decrease in the accPointsPerShare. hence the users will receive less reward then the actual.
`pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward/lpSupply + pool.accPointsPerShare;`

## Code Snippet
link to the code snippet : `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L766`.

    lpToken.approve(address(bridge), depositAmount);
    bridge.deposit(
            pool.l2Farm,            // _l2Receiver
            address(lpToken),       // _l1Token
            depositAmount,          // _amount
            200000,                 // _l2TxGasLimit
            0,                      // _l2TxGasPerPubdataByte
            owner()                 // _refundRecipient
        );
