# Storage collision in Proxy2Step due to lack of EIP1967

## Summary
Storage collision in Proxy2Step due to lack of EIP1967
## Vulnerability Detail
The Proxy2Step contract does not follow the [EIP-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967) standard for the consistent location where proxies store the address of the logic contract they delegate to.
