# Slippage attack: Admin can new pool after farming started. First depositor to new pool can inflate pool rewards by depositing a tiny amount of token



## Summary

The owner can add new pools after farming has started.
If this happens, an exploiter can deposit only 1e1 tokens into the new pool immediately after its creation, inflating the pool rewards by a factor of 1e18 times and breaking the reward distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is how the reward is calculated in the contract:

```solidity
    function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public {
        ....
        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;//deposit + boostAmount
        uint256 _pointsPerBlock = pointsPerBlock;//25e18
        uint256 _allocPoint = pool.allocPoint;//20000 could also be > 1e18
        uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());//block passed * 1e18
        uint256 pointReward =
            blockMultiplier *//blockDelta * 1e18
            _pointsPerBlock *// * 25e18
            _allocPoint /    // * 20000
            totalAllocPoint; // 80000
        //@spread points evenly between pools
        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward /
            lpSupply +//@audit why earned points divided by deposited amount? Some pool with bigger allocation will get smaller share of points if they have larger deposit?
            pool.accPointsPerShare;//@audit H if pool have low deposit like 1e1 token. accPoint earn will be inflated like ERC4626
        ....
}
```

Or simplified:
`pool.accPointsPerShare = (time passed * pool points) / tokenLPSupply + pool.accPointsPerShare;`

Pools only update accrued points after the farming start period. [Ref1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L164-L165), [Ref2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L340-L350)

An exploiter can inflate pool rewards by making `tokenLPSupply` as small as possible, which can occur when no one has deposited anything after the farming starts or when the admin adds a new pool like swellETH after farming has started. [Ref3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/scripts/deploy.py#L1-L18)

The latter is more likely to happen because there is no check to prevent adding new pools after farming starts, as [seen here. Ref4](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-sophon/blob/main/farming-contracts/contracts/farm/SophonFarming.sol#L154-L165)

```solidity
    function add(uint256 _allocPoint, address _lpToken, string memory _description, bool _withUpdate) public onlyOwner returns (uint256) {
        if (poolExists[_lpToken]) {
            revert PoolExists();
        }
        if (isFarmingEnded()) {
            revert FarmingIsEnded();
        }
        if (_withUpdate) {
            massUpdatePools();
        }
        uint256 lastRewardBlock =
            getBlockNumber() > startBlock ? getBlockNumber() : startBlock;//@audit no check prevent add new pool after farming started
```

## Impact

Under specific conditions, such as no one depositing before `startBlock` or the admin adding a new pool after `startBlock`, an exploiter can break the reward distribution and inflate the new pool's rewards to extreme values.

## Recommendation

Prevent adding new pools after farming has started to ensure all pools have enough time for users to deposit sufficient tokens, preventing slippage rewards attacks.
