# Lack of additional verification for `Upgradeable2Step::acceptImplementation` leads to unauthorized implementation acceptance

## Summary
The **`acceptImplementation`** function in the **`Upgradeable2Step`** contract lacks additional verification steps to ensure the legitimacy of the **`pendingImplementation`**, potentially allowing unauthorized implementation changes if the **`pendingImplementation`** address is compromised or malicious.
## Vulnerability Detail
The **`acceptImplementation`** function in the **`Upgradeable2Step`** contract can be called by any address that matches **`pendingImplementation`**. 

This function should be restricted to the owner or another trusted entity to prevent unauthorized changes.
## Impact
An attacker who gains control of the pendingImplementation address could replace the implementation contract with a malicious one, potentially stealing funds or disrupting the protocol's functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement additional verification mechanisms to ensure the legitimacy of the **`pendingImplementation`**. This could include multisignature approval, off-chain verification, or other methods to verify the identity and integrity of the **`pendingImplementation`**.

For example, you could add a multi-step verification process:

- Require multiple confirmations from trusted parties before allowing the **`acceptImplementation`** call.
- Introduce a delay between setting the **`pendingImplementation`** and allowing the **`acceptImplementation`** call, giving time to detect and react to any compromise.
