# Booster Proceeds Draining Using `withdrawProceeds()` Function in case of Private Key Hacks

## Summary
The withdrawProceeds function in SophonFarming.sol allows the contract owner to withdraw all booster proceeds from a specified pool without any checks or restrictions. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdrawProceeds` function in the `SophonFarming.sol` allows the owner to withdraw all booster proceeds from a specified pool. 

Without any checks or restrictions, a malicious owner could exploit this function to drain all booster proceeds from all pools.

```js
    function withdrawProceeds(uint256 _pid) external onlyOwner {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        uint256 _proceeds = heldProceeds[_pid];
        heldProceeds[_pid] = 0;
        pool.lpToken.safeTransfer(msg.sender, _proceeds);
        emit WithdrawProceeds(_pid, _proceeds);
    }
```

There is no timelock structure in the process of using this owner privilege. 

In parallel with the private key thefts of the project owners, which have increased recently, this vulnerability has been stated as medium.
## Impact
 if the owner's private key is compromised, an attacker could exploit this function to steal all the funds from the pools.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a timelock mechanism to use `onlyOwner` privileges.
