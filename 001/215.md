# potential temporary denial of service when adding the first pool with `_allocPoint == 0`

## Summary

when creating the first pools by calling `function add(uint256 _allocPoint, address _lpToken, string memory _description, bool _withUpdate) public onlyOwner returns (uint256)`, if the ` _allocPoint` is set to 0, all future calls to `function updatePool(uint256 _pid) public` will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

when creating new pools the `_allocPoint` is added to the `totalAllocPoint`, if the first pool is created with `_allocPoint` = 0, the `totalAllocPoint` still remains 0.
in the `function updatePool` the  pointReward is calculated as `uint256 pointReward = blockMultiplier * _pointsPerBlock *  _allocPoint / totalAllocPoint;`
This raises a division by zero exception.

## Impact

all calls to `function updatePool` revert
