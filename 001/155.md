# `setStartBlock` doesn't update the `lastRewardBlock`

## Summary
`setStartBlock` doesn't update the `lastRewardBlock`  and this can lead to `wrong` reward calculation

## Vulnerability Detail
Owner can update the startBlock before farming started
```solidity
    function setStartBlock(uint256 _startBlock) public onlyOwner {
        if (_startBlock == 0 || (endBlock != 0 && _startBlock >= endBlock)) {
            revert InvalidStartBlock();
        }
        if (getBlockNumber() > startBlock) {
            revert FarmingIsStarted();
        }
        startBlock = _startBlock;
    }
```
But the issue is `setStartBlock` doesn't `update` lastRewardBlock of pools. As a result `pool` will be started earlier or later but `reward` will be calculated based on old `lastRewardBlock`

## Impact
User can get less/more reward than expected

## Tool used
Manual Review + VS code

## Recommendation
`Update` the `lastRewardBlock` while updating `startBlock`
