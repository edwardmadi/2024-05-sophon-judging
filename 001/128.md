# Malicious/Compromised Owner have privilege to seize withdrawals from pool.

## Summary
In the current implementation, the owner of the contract is a trusted role allowed to update the `endBlocks` and `_withdrawBlocks` at any time. The `_withdrawBlocks` parameter defines the period during which users can withdraw their deposits from the pools. However, a compromised or malicious owner can set the `_withdrawalBlocks` to `0`, effectively seizing the rewards of all users who do not withdraw within the same block, thereby performing a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on withdrawals.

**Note:** Although the owner is a trusted role, the protocol must ensure a minimum threshold value for withdrawalBlocks when endBlocks != 0 to prevent unwanted or malicious activities.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `setEndBlock` function allows the owner to set the end block for farming and the withdrawal period. If the `_withdrawalBlocks` is set to `0`, users will only have the same block to withdraw their funds, which is practically impossible, leading to a situation where users are unable to withdraw their deposits.

#### Vulnerable Function

```solidity
function setEndBlock(uint256 _endBlock, uint256 _withdrawalBlocks) public onlyOwner {
    uint256 _endBlockForWithdrawals;
    if (_endBlock != 0) {
        if (_endBlock <= startBlock || getBlockNumber() > _endBlock) {
            revert InvalidEndBlock();
        }
        if (isFarmingEnded()) {
            revert FarmingIsEnded();
        }
@>  _endBlockForWithdrawals = _endBlock + _withdrawalBlocks; // @audit-issue can set to endBlocks + 0
    } else {
        _endBlockForWithdrawals = 0;
    }
    massUpdatePools();
    endBlock = _endBlock;
    endBlockForWithdrawals = _endBlockForWithdrawals;
}
```

### Attack Scenario

1. The owner sets up the farming contract and users deposit their tokens into the pools.
2. The owner, being compromised or malicious, sets the `endBlock` to a specific block number and the `_withdrawalBlocks` to `0`.
3. The end block is reached, and the withdrawal period is set to `0` blocks.
4. Users attempt to withdraw their deposits but are unable to do so because the withdrawal period is effectively zero.

### Proof of Concept

Run the following test: `forge test --match-test test_withdrawalBlocks_zero_withdraw`

```solidity
// File: farming-contracts/test/SophonFarming.t.sol
function test_withdrawalBlocks_zero_withdraw() public {
    // Setup
    deal(address(dai), account1, amountToDeposit);
    assertEq(dai.balanceOf(account1), amountToDeposit);

    // Constants
    uint256 amountToDeposit = 10e18;
    uint256 fractionToWithdraw = 30;
    uint256 poolId = sophonFarming.typeToId(SophonFarmingState.PredefinedPool.sDAI);
    uint256 depositAmount = sDAI.convertToShares(amountToDeposit);
    uint256 withdrawAmount = depositAmount / fractionToWithdraw;
    uint256 blocks = 10;

    // Account1 deposits into dai-sDAI pool
    vm.startPrank(account1);
    dai.approve(address(sophonFarming), amountToDeposit);
    sophonFarming.depositDai(amountToDeposit, 0);
    assertEq(dai.balanceOf(account1), 0);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Deployer sets the endBlocks to 10 and _withdrawBlocks to 0
    vm.prank(deployer);
    sophonFarming.setEndBlock(block.number + blocks, 0);

    // Mimic block number to pass end block
    vm.roll(block.number + blocks + 1);

    // Account1 tries to withdraw but fails with error WithdrawNotAllowed
    vm.startPrank(account1);
    vm.expectRevert(SophonFarming.WithdrawNotAllowed.selector);
    sophonFarming.withdraw(poolId, withdrawAmount);
}
```

## Impact
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on all users, preventing them from withdrawing their funds.

Foundry

## Recommendation
**Impose Minimum Withdrawal Blocks:** Implement a minimum threshold for the `_withdrawalBlocks` (when endBlocks !=0 ) parameter to ensure users have a reasonable timeframe to withdraw their deposits.
