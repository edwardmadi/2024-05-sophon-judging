# [M-1] `SophonFarming::_pendingPoints` - Division Before Multiplication Causes Precision Loss

## Summary
The `_pendingPoints` function in the `SophonFarming` contract performs division before multiplication, which can lead to precision loss when dealing with small numbers or when the divisor is greater than the dividend. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Proof of Concept:
blockMultiplier = 1000
pointsPerBlock = 1e18
pool.allocPoint = 1
totalAllocPoint = 1000000
lpSupply = 1e18

Plugging these values into the original code:
```javascript
uint256 pointReward = 1000 * 1e18 * 1 / 1000000;
accPointsPerShare = pointReward * 1e18 / 1e18 + accPointsPerShare;
```

Simplifying the calculations:
```javascript
uint256 pointReward = 1e15 / 1000000;
accPointsPerShare = pointReward + accPointsPerShare;
```

## Impact
The precision loss caused by performing division before multiplication can result in incorrect calculations of pending points for users in the `_pendingPoints` function. This can lead to users receiving fewer points than they should, affecting the fairness and accuracy of the reward distribution in the SophonFarming protocol.

The value of `pointReward` will be truncated to 0 because the division by `1000000` is performed before the multiplication by `1e18`. As a result, `accPointsPerShare` will not be incremented, leading to a loss of precision.

However, if the order of operations is changed to perform multiplication before division, the precision loss can be mitigated:
```javascript
uint256 pointReward = 1000 * 1e18 * 1 * 1e18 / 1000000 / 1e18;
accPointsPerShare = pointReward + accPointsPerShare;
```
Simplifying the calculations:
```javascript
uint256 pointReward = 1e33 / 1000000 / 1e18;
accPointsPerShare = pointReward + accPointsPerShare;
```
In this case, the value of pointReward will be correctly calculated as 1e15, and accPointsPerShare will be incremented accordingly, preserving the precision.

## Tool used
Math
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, the order of operations in the _pendingPoints function should be changed to perform multiplication before division. Modify the affected lines of code as follows:
```javascript
uint256 pointReward = blockMultiplier * pointsPerBlock * pool.allocPoint * 1e18 / totalAllocPoint / lpSupply;
accPointsPerShare = pointReward + accPointsPerShare;
```
This modification ensures that the calculations are performed with the highest possible precision before any truncation occurs due to division.
