# Adding pool with _withUpdate being false will lead to incorrect calcualation of point rewards

## Summary
Adding pool with `_withUpdate` being false will lead to incorrect calcualation of point rewards
## Vulnerability Detail
When adding a pool the owner is given the option to add the pool and set the parameter  `_withUpdate` to false. This is a problem because if the owner where to add a new update with `_withUpdate` as false, this will cause other pool's reward calcuation to be off.

in the `add` fucntion with no update we only update the totalAllocPoint variable 
```solidity
        totalAllocPoint = totalAllocPoint + _allocPoint;
```
this is problematic because if a pool who has been earning rewards under a lower `totalAllocPoint` is not updated, before the addition of the new pool, their previous rewards will be incorrectly calulated.

Let us assume that a user of pool A which was added 10 blocks ago, deposits for 10 blocks and gains 10 point under the `totalAllocPoint` of 100 his reward for the week will be 

```solidity
            uint256 pointReward =
                blockMultiplier *
                pointsPerBlock *
                pool.allocPoint /
                totalAllocPoint;
```

assume 
block multiplier = 100
points perblock = 10
and alloc point = 10
totalAllocPoint = 200

his point reward will = 50

now if a new pool is added with 200 alloc points, the totalAllocPoint will be updated but his pool will not
calculation showing above;
100 *
10 *
10 /
400 =  25
so now the user will have his reward = 25. even though he stakes for 10 block with previous totalAllocPoint, when his pool is updated, when he withdraws he will only be due 25 points instead of 50.
## Impact
Users point calculation will be incorrect leading to loss of points for all users of a specific pool

## Recommendation
do not allow option of adding pool without update.
