# No check for minimum amount of withdrawal blocks - might reduce trust in the system if farming can be ended with 0 withdrawal period

## Summary

Withdrawal blocks can be set to zero, which means that stakers will be unable to withdraw their deposits when farming ends

## Vulnerability Detail

`SophonFarming::setEndBlock` doesn't enforce a minimum amount of blocks for `_withdrawalBlocks` , this means that the withdrawal preiod can technically be set to 0 blocks, which means that stakers will be unable to withdraw their deposits when farming ends as the `endBlockForWithdrawal` will be equal to `endBlock`. 
while it mightly seem unlikely , the possibility of stakers loosing their funds might diminish trust in the system or deter them from staking **as intended** as there is no guaranteed withdrawal period when farming ends. 

## Impact

Users tokens can be permanently locked

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

include a check for minimum amount of withdrawal blocks

```sol
function setEndBlock(uint256 _endBlock, uint256 _withdrawalBlocks) public onlyOwner {
        uint256 _endBlockForWithdrawals;
        if (_endBlock != 0) {
            if (_endBlock <= startBlock || getBlockNumber() > _endBlock) {
                revert InvalidEndBlock();
            }
            if (_withdrawalBlocks < MIN_WITHDRAWAL_BLOCKS) {//MIN_WITHDRAWAL_BLOCKS could be 7200(approx no. of blocks in a day)
                revert InvalidWithdrawalBlocks();
            }
            if (isFarmingEnded()) {
                revert FarmingIsEnded();
            }
            _endBlockForWithdrawals = _endBlock + _withdrawalBlocks;
        } else {
            // withdrawal blocks needs an endBlock
            _endBlockForWithdrawals = 0;
        }
        massUpdatePools();
        endBlock = _endBlock;
        endBlockForWithdrawals = _endBlockForWithdrawals;
    }
```
