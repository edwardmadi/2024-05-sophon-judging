# wrong calculation on sophonFarming._pendingPoints

## Summary
in the function _pendingPoints contract SophonFarming **accPointsPerShare** is calculated wrongly which will cause for point to not be calculated correctly 
## Vulnerability Detail
on line 361 contract SophonFarming.sol  the **accPointsPerShare** is calculated with **1e18**  which will result into a wrong point calculation unlike  how **user.rewardDebt** and  **user.rewardSettled** are calculated in the deposit  function where   in the  **_pendingPoints function  **pool.accPointsPerShare** is multiplied with 1e18   and it will try to divide with 1e36 but still its wrong  and  also since    the function **updatePool**   **pool.accPointsPerShare** is not calculated  both function uses different calculations  which lead to wrong point
## Impact
wrong point calculation lead  to wrong point of distribution
