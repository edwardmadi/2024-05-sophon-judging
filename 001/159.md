# The formula for calculating pending points is incorrect


## Summary
The formula for calculating pending points is incorrect
## Vulnerability Detail
The comment specification is in SophonFarmingState.sol is below:
```javascript
//   pending reward = (user.amount * pool.accPointsPerShare) - user.rewardDebt
```
howerve in `_pendingPoints` function, user.rewardSettled has been added extraly.
```javascript
function _pendingPoints(uint256 _pid, address _user) internal view returns (uint256) {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user];

        uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;

        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        if (getBlockNumber() > pool.lastRewardBlock && lpSupply != 0) {
            uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());

            uint256 pointReward =
                blockMultiplier *
                pointsPerBlock *
                pool.allocPoint /
                totalAllocPoint;
            accPointsPerShare = pointReward *
                1e18 /
                lpSupply +
                accPointsPerShare;
        }

        return user.amount *
            accPointsPerShare /
            1e36 +
@>            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;
    }
```
## Impact
Making the user believe they can obtain more points than they should.
