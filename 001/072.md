# Pools will remain with their old `startTime` if `startTime` is changed to earlier.

## Summary
Pools might be forced to start the reward accrual later than supposed to.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a pool is added, if `startBlock` is in the future, the pool's `lastRewardBlock ` gets set to `startBlock`
```solidity
        uint256 lastRewardBlock =
            getBlockNumber() > startBlock ? getBlockNumber() : startBlock;
        totalAllocPoint = totalAllocPoint + _allocPoint;
        poolExists[_lpToken] = true;

        uint256 pid = poolInfo.length;

        poolInfo.push(
            PoolInfo({
                lpToken: IERC20(_lpToken),
                l2Farm: address(0),
                amount: 0,
                boostAmount: 0,
                depositAmount: 0,
                allocPoint: _allocPoint,
                lastRewardBlock: lastRewardBlock,
                accPointsPerShare: 0,
                description: _description
            })
        );
```
The problem is that `startBlock` value can be changed

```solidity
    function setStartBlock(uint256 _startBlock) public onlyOwner {
        if (_startBlock == 0 || (endBlock != 0 && _startBlock >= endBlock)) {
            revert InvalidStartBlock();
        }
        if (getBlockNumber() > startBlock) {
            revert FarmingIsStarted();
        }
        startBlock = _startBlock;
    }
```

In the case that `startBlock` is reduced, pools created prior to that will only start accruing points after the old `startBlock` passes.

Any new added pool (or adjusted via `set`) will start accruing points from the new `startBlock` on.

## Impact
Some pools will start accruing rewards later than the others

## Recommendation
upon changing startBlock, adjust all pools accordingly.
