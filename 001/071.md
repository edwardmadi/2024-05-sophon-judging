# `add` and `set` should always update all pools

## Summary
if pools are not updated prior to `add`/`set`, accounting will be broken 

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling `add`/`set`, this changes the `totalAlloc` and the pool's relative allocation one with another.
If upon such call, pools are not updated, it would cause discrepancies.

Let's say if there have been only 2 pools with equal allocation which have not been updated for X time and then a third pool is added with same allocation, if pools are not updated before the `add`, rewards will be calculated as if the 2 pools have had 33% of total allocation throughout the whole time X.

## Impact
Incorrect rewards calculation
