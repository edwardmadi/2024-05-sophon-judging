# wrong calculation of "accPointsPerShare" in _pendingPoints

## Summary
wrong calculation of accPointsPerShare leads to wrong calculation in _pendingPoints.
## Vulnerability Detail

   As   here we are calculating   accPointsPerShare = pointReward * 1e18 / lpSupply + accPointsPerShare;              1
and we are returning        user.amount *accPointsPerShare /1e36 + user.rewardSettled - user.rewardDebt;             2

as pointReward * 1e18  is in the range of 1e36  but accPointsPerShare is in the range of  1e18  ,when we divide this by 1e36 (as shown in 2) ,this will lead to wrong calculation.
        

function _pendingPoints(uint256 _pid, address _user) internal view returns (uint256) {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
        UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user];

        uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;

        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        if (getBlockNumber() > pool.lastRewardBlock && lpSupply != 0) {
            uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber());

            uint256 pointReward =
                blockMultiplier *
                pointsPerBlock *
                pool.allocPoint /
                totalAllocPoint;

    @>>        accPointsPerShare = pointReward *
                1e18 /
                lpSupply +
                accPointsPerShare;
        }

   @>>     return user.amount *
            accPointsPerShare /
            1e36 +
            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;
    }
## Impact
_pendingPoints will return wrong value.
