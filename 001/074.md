# Malicious depositor can `deposit` assets before `startBlock` to game the `rewardSettled`

## Summary
Malicious depositor can `deposit` assets before `startBlock` to game the `rewardSettled`

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user deposit assets to `SophonFarming`, user gets `rewardSettled` based on the number of blocks he was deposited for since `startBlock`
```solidity
       uint256 userAmount = user.amount;
        user.rewardSettled =
            userAmount *
            pool.accPointsPerShare /
            1e18 +
            user.rewardSettled -
            user.rewardDebt;
```
As there is `no check` for stoping deposits `before` startBlock, a malicious user can `deposit` assets before startBlock and will have `rewards` at startBlock(when actually farming is started)

//Here is the POC 
```solidity
  function test_rewardSettledIsGamed() public {
        //Set startBlock = block.number + 100 in setUp()
        uint amountToDeposit = 100e18;
        vm.deal(account1, amountToDeposit);
        vm.startPrank(account1);

        uint256 poolId = sophonFarming.typeToId(
            SophonFarmingState.PredefinedPool.wstETH
        );

        //Depositing 100e18 ie amountToDeposit before startBlock
        sophonFarming.depositEth{value: amountToDeposit}(
            0,
            SophonFarmingState.PredefinedPool.wstETH
        );

        //Reward at startBlock
        vm.roll(block.number + 101);
        console.log(
            "Reward accumulated until startBlock:",
            sophonFarming.pendingPoints(poolId, account1)
        );
    }
```

## Impact
Malicious user will have `rewardSettled` just after farming started

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check that `prevent` users from `depositing` assets before farming started ie `startBlock`
