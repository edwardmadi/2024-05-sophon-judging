The image above easily sums up the issue.

Let's say that the owner has set the `startBlock` as block - 0 and `endBlock` as block - 100.

At block 10, the first `deposit` happens.

If you look at the flow of calls, `deposit` calls `_deposit` which then calls the `updatePool` function. The following if block in `updatePool` gets executed -

```solidity
        uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
        uint256 _pointsPerBlock = pointsPerBlock;
        uint256 _allocPoint = pool.allocPoint;
        if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
            pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();
            return;
        }
```
Note that `lpSupply` or `pool.amount` is 0 because no deposits before this deposit were called. `pool.amount` only gets updated in functions like deposit and withdraw which did not happen before this deposit function was called. Hence, the if block gets executed and `pool.lastRewardBlock = getBlockNumber();`. This updation of `pool.lastRewardBlock` here is problematic as it leads to a loss of reward accumulation. The value returned by `_getBlockMultiplier` decreases.

Due to this update, the lastRewardBlock is set to 10. But, rewards started accumulating from block - 0. So, the rewards that would have accumulated from blocks 0 - 10 have been lost.

Let's say that another deposit happens at block - 15. So, the value returned by `_getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber())` at block - 15 inside `updatePool` will be:

`(_to - _from) * 1e18` = (15 - 10) * 1e18 = 5e18

`from` equals 10 because the first deposit updated the `lastRewardBlock` to 10. Had the first deposit transaction not updated the value of `lastRewardBlock` it would still have been equal to 0. In that case, the value returned by `_getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber())` would be:

`(_to - _from) * 1e18` = (15 - 0) * 1e18 = 15e18

There is clearly a loss in reward accumulation.

As `blockMultiplier` (`_getBlockMultiplier(pool.lastRewardBlock, getBlockNumber())`) is used to calculate the value of `pointReward` and `pool.accPointsPerShare`, these values will decrease because of incorrect updation.

Note, that the severity of the issue depends on when the first deposit happens. The situation above could have been even more worse if the first deposit was made on block - 50 or block - 80.

## Impact
Rewards accumulate from block - 0. So, when latestRewardBlock is updated to be equal to block - 10 on the first deposit. There is a clear loss of rewards because rewards from from block - 0 to block - 10 are not taken into to account.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The if block within the `updatePool` function needs to be updated as:

```solidity
        if (lpSupply == 0 || _pointsPerBlock == 0 || _allocPoint == 0) {
            return;
        }
```
