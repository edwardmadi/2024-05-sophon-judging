# Division before multiplication leads to a loss in value returned by the `_pendingPoints` function.

## Summary
Division before multiplication leads to a loss in the value returned by the `_pendingPoints` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_pendingPoints` function `accPointsPerShare` is calculated as: 

` uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;` 

1e18 should be multiplied in the `updatePool` function during the calculation `pool.accPointsPerShare `. So instead of this code block:

```solidity
        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward /
            lpSupply +
            pool.accPointsPerShare;
```

This code block should be used:

```solidity
        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward * 1e18 /
            lpSupply +
            pool.accPointsPerShare;
```
Because in the former code block, multiplication is performed after division. So, if `pointReward`/`lpSupply` < 1, the value of this ratio will be lost in the 1st code block. Hence, the value returned by `_pendingPoints` will be less than what it should be.

## Impact
Precision loss due to division before multiplication leads to a smaller value being returned by the `_pendingPoints` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use this code block to update `pool.accPointsPerShare`:

```solidity
        pool.accPointsPerShare = pointReward * 1e18 /
            lpSupply +
            pool.accPointsPerShare;
```
