# Precision loss in `SophonFarming.sol:_pendingPoints`.

## Summary
In this function multiplication is done after the division which  can lead to the precision loss

## Vulnerability Detail
`pointReward` is calculated by multiplying `(blockMultiplier *pointsPerBlock *pool.allocPoint )` and then dividing by `totalAllocPoint`. Then after division it is getting multipled by `1e18` and divided by  `(lpSupply + accPointsPerShare)` and `accPointsPerShare` has `1e18` decimal place. This can lead to a precision loss.

## Impact
depositors may get less reward due to precision loss.
