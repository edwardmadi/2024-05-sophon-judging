# Incorrect Reward Calculation Due to Unupdated `lastRewardBlock` When `startBlock` is Reduced or Increased

## Summary
The `SophonFarming` contract has a vulnerability where reducing/Increasing the `startBlock` after pools have been created does not update the `lastRewardBlock` for those pools. This can lead to incorrect reward calculations, as the `_getBlockMultiplier` function will use the outdated `lastRewardBlock`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the `startBlock` is reduced, the `lastRewardBlock` for existing pools is not updated to reflect the new `startBlock`. This misalignment causes the `_getBlockMultiplier` function to calculate rewards based on an outdated `lastRewardBlock`, leading to incorrect reward distribution.

## Impact
- **Incorrect Reward Calculation:** Users may receive incorrect rewards due to the misalignment between `startBlock` and `lastRewardBlock` and Similarly Protocol can loss rewards if the the `startBlock` is increased.

## Code Snippet
The issue lies in the `setStartBlock` function:
```solidity
    function setStartBlock(uint256 _startBlock) public onlyOwner {
        if (_startBlock == 0 || (endBlock != 0 && _startBlock >= endBlock)) {
            revert InvalidStartBlock();
        }
        if (getBlockNumber() > startBlock) {
            revert FarmingIsStarted();
        }
        startBlock = _startBlock;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the `lastRewardBlock` for all pools when the `startBlock` is changed. 
Here is a suggested fix:

```solidity
function setStartBlock(uint256 _startBlock) public onlyOwner {
    if (_startBlock == 0 || (endBlock != 0 && _startBlock >= endBlock)) {
        revert InvalidStartBlock();
    }
    if (getBlockNumber() > startBlock) {
        revert FarmingIsStarted();
    }
    startBlock = _startBlock;

    // Update lastRewardBlock for all pools
    for (uint256 pid = 0; pid < poolInfo.length; pid++) {
        PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[pid];
        if (pool.lastRewardBlock < _startBlock) {
            pool.lastRewardBlock = _startBlock;
        }
    }
}
```
