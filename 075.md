# Centralization Risk in `SophonFarming::setBridge` Function and globally in the contract.

## Summary
The setBridge function allows only the owner to update the bridge contract. This introduces a centralization risk where the owner can change critical contract components unilaterally, potentially leading to abuse or security risks.


## Code Snippet

And globally, the centralization risk in the contract.

## Impact
Single Point of Failure: If the owner's account is compromised or if the owner acts maliciously, they could update the bridge contract to a malicious address. This could lead to the loss of user funds and trust in the system.

Potential for Abuse: The owner could exploit this power to divert assets to unauthorized locations or to disrupt the normal operations of the protocol.

Reduced Trust: Centralization of such critical functions can reduce the trust users have in the protocol, as they must rely on the good behavior and security practices of a single individual or entity.

## Vulnerability Detail

Malicious Bridge Contract: The owner sets the bridge contract to a malicious contract they control, allowing them to steal funds during the bridging process.

Disruption of Service: The owner sets the bridge contract to an invalid or non-functional address, causing legitimate asset transfers to fail and disrupting the protocol's operations.

Compromised Owner Account: If the owner's private key is compromised, the attacker could set the bridge contract to an address they control, leading to the same risks as above.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Introduce a governance mechanism to allow community consensus for such critical updates, or implement a time-lock mechanism to delay the effect of such changes, providing enough time for users to react.
