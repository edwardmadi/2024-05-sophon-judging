# Wrong parameter description in SophonFarming::setEndBlock

## Summary
Parameter _withdrawalBlocks in SophonFarming::setEndBlock has an incorrect description.

## Vulnerability Detail
The natspec says '_withdrawalBlocks the last block that withdrawals are allowed', but later in the function the code is:

```solidity
_endBlockForWithdrawals = _endBlock + _withdrawalBlocks;
endBlockForWithdrawals = _endBlockForWithdrawals;
```

In conclusion, natspec tells that _withdrawalBlocks is the last block in which users are allowed to withdraw, while it is the number of blocks in which users are able to withdraw since the endBlock.

## Impact
Developers/auditors may have a wrong understanding of the codebase due to this confusing natspec of the parameter, while owner role address could use the function with an undesired parameter value by mistake. Taking into account that the last withdrawal block will be greater than _endBlock, the real last withdrawal block (_endBlock + _withdrawalBlocks) will be such a higher value than expected, leading to a such a long period for withdrawals.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Edit the natspec so that the description of the parameter is totally clear:
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Set the end block of the farm
     * @param _endBlock the end block
-    * @param _withdrawalBlocks the last block that withdrawals are allowed
+   * @param _withdrawalBlocks number of blocks from _endBlock on in which withdrawals are allowed
     */
    function setEndBlock(uint256 _endBlock, uint256 _withdrawalBlocks) public onlyOwner {
