# Non-linear_Points_Per_Block

## Summary
In `SophonFarming`, the distribution of points per block is observed to be non-linear. This was confirmed to be **unintended** after contacting the protocol's team.

## Vulnerability Detail
The distribution of points per block was found to be non-linear when in fact it should be.

## Impact
This inconsistency can lead to users loosing/receiving more points that they should for a given amount of blocks. This can lead to unequal rewards and potential dissatisfaction among participants.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _pendingPoints(
	uint256 _pid,
	address _user
) internal view returns (uint256) {
	PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
	UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][_user];
	
	uint256 accPointsPerShare = pool.accPointsPerShare * 1e18;
	
	uint256 lpSupply = pool.amount;
	if (getBlockNumber() > pool.lastRewardBlock && lpSupply != 0) {
		uint256 blockMultiplier = _getBlockMultiplier(
		pool.lastRewardBlock,
		getBlockNumber()
		); 
		
		uint256 pointReward = (blockMultiplier *
		pointsPerBlock *
		pool.allocPoint) / totalAllocPoint;
		
		accPointsPerShare =
		(pointReward * 1e18) /
		lpSupply +
		accPointsPerShare;
	}
	
	return
	(user.amount * accPointsPerShare) /
	1e36 +
	user.rewardSettled -
	user.rewardDebt;
}
```

## Proof Of Concept
```solidity
function testFuzz_TwoStakersOneWithdrawsBlockEarlier(
    uint256 amountToDeposit,
    uint256 fractionToWithdraw
) public {
    vm.assume(amountToDeposit > 1e6 && amountToDeposit <= 1_000_000_000e18);
    vm.assume(fractionToWithdraw > 0 && fractionToWithdraw <= 10);

    uint256 poolId = sophonFarming.typeToId(
        SophonFarmingState.PredefinedPool.sDAI
    );
    uint256 depositAmount = sDAI.convertToShares(amountToDeposit);
    uint256 withdrawAmount = depositAmount / fractionToWithdraw;
    uint256 blockNumber = 1;
    uint256 blocks = 10;

    deal(address(dai), account1, amountToDeposit);
    assertEq(dai.balanceOf(account1), amountToDeposit);

    vm.startPrank(account1);
    dai.approve(address(sophonFarming), amountToDeposit);
    sophonFarming.depositDai(amountToDeposit, 0);
    assertEq(dai.balanceOf(account1), 0);
    vm.stopPrank();

    deal(address(dai), account2, amountToDeposit);
    assertEq(dai.balanceOf(account2), amountToDeposit);

    vm.startPrank(account2);
    dai.approve(address(sophonFarming), amountToDeposit);
    sophonFarming.depositDai(amountToDeposit, 0);
    assertEq(dai.balanceOf(account2), 0);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.prank(deployer);
    sophonFarming.setEndBlock(blockNumber + blocks, 1);
    vm.prank(deployer);
    sophonFarming.set(poolId, 1000, true);
    vm.roll(blockNumber + blocks - 1);

    vm.prank(account1);
    sophonFarming.withdraw(poolId, type(uint256).max);

    vm.roll(blockNumber + blocks);

    assertEq(
        sophonFarming.pendingPoints(poolId, account1) * 1e10,
        sophonFarming.pendingPoints(poolId, account2) *
            1e10 -
            ((sophonFarming.pendingPoints(poolId, account2) * 1e10) /
                blocks)
    );
}
```

Account 1 staked for 9 blocks and account 2 for 10, so the assumption is that if from the points of account 2 we subtract the division of the points of account 2 with blocks (which should be the points per block) we should get the points if account 2 also staked for 9 and not for 10 blocks. And this whole assumption should be true because the whole rewards system is linear by design. However, the test fails. 

It fails with these values:

27439024390243902430000000000

```

## Recommendation
Consider reworking the points calculation algorithm to ensure a linear and fair distribution of rewards to the stakers, as described in the [RareSkills staking algorithm article](https://www.rareskills.io/post/staking-algorithm).
