# Incorrect Calculation in `getMaxAdditionalBoost` Function

## Summary
The `getMaxAdditionalBoost` function, called within the `increaseBoost` function, inaccurately calculates the maximum additional boost that a user can apply. This miscalculation may lead to users unintentionally increasing their boost beyond their deposited amount.
## Vulnerability Detail

Within the `increaseBoost` function, the contract calls `getMaxAdditionalBoost` to determine the `maximum additional boost` a user can apply. However, the `getMaxAdditionalBoost` function returns the entire `deposit ` amount without subtracting the previously applied boost amount. This oversight allows users to potentially increase their boost beyond their actual deposited amount.

## Impact
Users may mistakenly increase their boost beyond their deposited amount, leading to inconsistencies in reward calculations and disrupting the intended functionality of the farming mechanism. This vulnerability could result in unexpected behavior and adversely affect the fairness and integrity of the system.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revise the getMaxAdditionalBoost function to accurately calculate the maximum additional boost by subtracting the previously applied boost amount from the user's deposit.
