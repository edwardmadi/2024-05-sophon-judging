# The `msg.sender` access control check in the `Upgradeable2Step.becomeImplementation()` function is not suitable for its intended purpose

## Summary

The `becomeImplementation()` function expects the `msg.sender` to be the owner of the proxy contract passed as a parameter, not the owner of the contract itself. This access control mechanism does not align with the intended purpose of the `2step` upgrade process.

## Vulnerability Detail

For an `Upgradeable2Step` contract, the `becomeImplementation()` function must be called to accept becoming the new implementation for another proxy. However, the `msg.sender` in the `becomeImplementation()` function is expected to be the owner of the other proxy contract. This access control mechanism does not align with the intended purpose of the `2step` upgrade process.

```solidity
        if (msg.sender != proxy.owner()) {
            revert Unauthorized();
        }
```

## Impact

It is possible to modify the implementation without the new implementation contract's aggrement.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend to modify the `msg.sender` check in the `becomeImplementation()`.

```diff
    function becomeImplementation(Upgradeable2Step proxy) public {
-       if (msg.sender != proxy.owner()) {
+       if (msg.sender != owner()) {
            revert Unauthorized();
        }
        proxy.acceptImplementation();
    }
```
