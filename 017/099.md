# Incorrect caller check in the `Upgradeable2Step.becomeImplementation()` function.

## Summary

The `becomeImplementation()` function should be called by the owner of the contract itself, not the owner of the parameter proxy.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's follow the flow to reset the implementation:

1. The owner of Proxy A sets the `pendingImplementation` to the address of Proxy B by calling the `replaceImplementation()`.

```solidity
    function replaceImplementation(address impl_) public onlyOwner {
        pendingImplementation = impl_;
        emit ReplaceImplementationStarted(implementation, impl_);
    }
```

2. To actually reset the implementation to Proxy B, the `acceptImplementation()` function of Proxy A should be called by Proxy B. So, the owner of Proxy B calls Proxy B's `becomeImplementation()` function with Proxy A as the parameter.

```solidity
    function becomeImplementation(Upgradeable2Step proxy) public {
34     if (msg.sender != proxy.owner()) {
            revert Unauthorized();
        }
        proxy.acceptImplementation();
    }
```

However, as you can see at `L34`, the `becomeImplementation()` function requires the caller to be the owner of Proxy A. So, the transaction will be reverted since the caller is the owner of Proxy B.

## Impact

Changing the implementation is not possible.

## Recommendation

The `becomeImplementation()` function should be fixed as follows.

```diff
-   function becomeImplementation(Upgradeable2Step proxy) public {
-      if (msg.sender != proxy.owner()) {
-           revert Unauthorized();
-       }
+   function becomeImplementation(Upgradeable2Step proxy) public onlyOwner {
        proxy.acceptImplementation();
    }
```
